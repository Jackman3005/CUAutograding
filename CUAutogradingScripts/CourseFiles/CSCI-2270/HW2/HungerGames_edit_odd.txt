games 
the tributes 
when i wake up the other side of the bed is cold my 
only the rough canvas cover of the mattress she 
mother of course she did this is the day of the 
i prop myself up on one elbow theres enough light in 
up on her side cocooned in my mothers body their 
younger still worn but not so beatendown prims 
primrose for which she was named my mother was 
sitting at prims knees guarding her is the worlds 
eyes the color of rotting squash prim named him 
matched the bright flower i le hates me or at least 
still remembers how i tried to drown him in a bucket 
swollen with worms crawling with fleas the last 
begged so hard cried even i had to let him stay it 
hes a born mouser even catches the occasional rat 
entrails he has stopped hissing at me 
come to love 
i swing my legs off the bed and slide into my hunting 
pull on trousers a shirt tuck my long dark braid up 
under a wooden bowl to protect it from hungry rats 
wrapped in basil leaves prims gift to me on reaping 
outside 
usually crawling with coal miners heading out to the 
hunched shoulders swollen knuckles many who 
out of their broken nails the lines of their sunken 
shutters on the squat gray houses are closed the 
can 
have to pass a few gates to reach the scruffy field 
woods in fact enclosing all of district 12 is a high 
theory its supposed to be electrified twentyfour 
in the woods — packs of wild dogs lone cougars 
were lucky to get two or three hours of electricity in 
always take a moment to listen carefully for the hum 
stone concealed by a clump of bushes i flatten out 
been loose for years there are several other weak 
almost always enter the woods here 
as soon as im in the trees i retrieve a bow and 
the fence has been successful at keeping the flesh 
freely and there are added concerns like venomous 
but theres also food if you know how to find it my 
blown to bits in a mine explosion there was nothing 
wake up screaming for him to run 
poaching carries the severest of penalties more 
are not bold enough to venture out with just a knife 
few others that i keep well hidden in the woods 
could have made good money selling them but if the 
executed for inciting a rebellion most of the 
hunt because theyre as hungry for fresh meat as 
customers but the idea that someone might be 
in the fall a few brave souls sneak into the woods to 
always close enough to run back to the safety of 
you can starve to death in safety i mutter then i 
the middle of nowhere you worry someone might 
when i was younger i scared my mother to death 
 
off city called the capitol eventually i understood 
to hold my tongue and to turn my features into an 
thoughts do my work quietly in school make only 
more than trades in the hob which is the black 
home where i am less pleasant i avoid discussing 
the hunger games prim might begin to repeat my 
in the woods waits the only person with whom i can 
relaxing my pace quickening as i climb the hills to 
of berry bushes protects it from unwanted eyes the 
says i never smile except in the woods 
but when i first told him i had barely whispered it 
lynx started following me around the woods looking 
finally had to kill the lynx because he scared off 
company but i got a decent price for his pelt 
an arrow stuck in it and i laugh its real bakery 
grain rations i take it in my hands pull out the 
inhaling the fragrance that makes my mouth flood 
occasions 
mm still warm i say he must have been at the 
it cost you 
sentimental this morning says gale even wished 
well we all feel a little closer today dont we i say 
cheese i pull it out 
prim well have a real feast suddenly he falls into a 
maniacally upbeat woman who arrives once a year to 
happy hunger games he plucks a few blackberries 
he tosses a berry in a high arc toward me 
with my teeth the sweet tartness explodes across my 
verve we have to joke about it because the 
the capitol accent is so affected almost anything 
i watch as gale pulls out his knife and slices the 
olive skin we even have the same gray eyes but were 
who work the mines resemble one another this way 
and blue eyes always look out of place they are my 
class that caters to officials peacekeepers and the 
occasional seam customer they ran an apothecary 
one can afford doctors apothecaries are our healers 
hunts he would sometimes collect medicinal herbs 
she must have really loved him to leave her home for 
the woman who sat by blank and unreachable while 
her for my fathers sake but to be honest im not the 
gale spreads the bread slices with the soft goat 
strip the bushes of their berries we settle back in a 
but have a clear view of the valley which is teeming 
iridescent in the sunlight the day is glorious with a 
the cheese seeping into the warm bread and the 
perfect if this really was a holiday if all the day off 
hunting for tonights supper but instead we have to 
the names to be called out 
what i ask 
and i we could make it says gale 
preposterous 
if we didnt have so many kids he adds quickly 
be gales two little brothers and a sister prim and 
how would they live without us who would fill those 
us hunting daily there are still nights when game has 
nights when we go to bed with our stomachs 
i never want to have kids i say 
but you do i say irritated 
the conversation feels all wrong leave how could i 
certain i love and gale is devoted to his family we 
if we did    even if we did    where did this stuff 
anything romantic between gale and me when we 
was only two years older he already looked like a 
friends to stop haggling over every trade and begin 
besides if he wants kids gale wont have any trouble 
to handle the work in the mines and he can hunt 
when he walks by in school that they want him it 
makes me jealous but not for the reason people would 
what do you want to do i ask we can hunt fish 
lets fish at the lake we can leave our poles and 
he says 
celebrate and a lot of people do out of relief that 
at least two families will pull their shutters lock their 
painful weeks to come 
when easier tastier prey abounds by late morning 
a gallon of strawberries i found the patch a few years 
it to keep out the animals 
market that operates in an abandoned warehouse 
efficient system that transported the coal directly 
over the space most businesses are closed by this 
busy we easily trade six of the fish for good bread 
woman who sells bowls of hot soup from a large 
exchange for a couple of chunks of paraffin we might 
keep on good terms with greasy sae shes the only 
 
attacked and you take out a dog or two well meat is 
sae says with a wink no one in the seam would turn 
peacekeepers who come to the hob can afford to be a 
when we finish our business at the market we go to 
strawberries knowing he has a particular fondness 
daughter madge opens the door shes in my year at 
to be a snob but shes all right she just keeps to 
group of friends we seem to end up together a lot at 
assemblies partnering for sports activities we rarely 
today her drab school outfit has been replaced by an 
with a pink ribbon reaping clothes 
madge shoots him a look trying to see if its a 
pretty dress but she would never be wearing it 
smiles well if i end up going to the capitol i want 
now its gales turn to be confused does she mean 
second 
you wont be going to the capitol says gale coolly 
dress real gold beautifully crafted it could keep a 
entries i had six when i was just twelve years old 
no its no ones fault just the way it is says gale 
money for the berries in my hand good luck 
we walk toward the seam in silence i dont like that 
the reaping system is unfair with the poor getting 
day you turn twelve that year your name is entered 
you reach the age of eighteen the final year of 
times thats true for every citizen in all twelve 
but heres the catch say you are poor and starving 
in exchange for tesserae each tessera is worth a 
you may do this for each of your family members as 
four times once because i had to and three times 
mother in fact every year i have needed to do this 
sixteen my name will be in the reaping twenty times 
singlehandedly feeding a family of five for seven 
 
been at risk of needing a tessera can set him off the 
compared to those of us who live in the seam not 
set up by the capitol not the districts certainly not 
have to sign up for tesserae 
other days deep in the woods ive listened to him 
cause misery in our district a way to plant hatred 
who can generally count on supper and thereby 
capitols advantage to have us divided among 
but mine if it wasnt reaping day if a girl with a gold 
thought was a harmless comment 
smoldering underneath his stony expression his 
its not that i dont agree with him i do but what 
woods it doesnt change anything it doesnt make 
scares off the nearby game i let him yell though 
gale and i divide our spoils leaving two fish a couple 
strawberries salt paraffin and a bit of money for 
see you in the square i say 
wear something pretty he says flatly 
my mother wears a fine dress from her apothecary 
ruffled blouse its a bit big on her but my mother 
trouble keeping the blouse tucked in at the back 
and sweat from the woods and even wash my hair to 
lovely dresses for me a soft blue thing with matching 
are you sure i ask im trying to get past rejecting 
wouldnt allow her to do anything for me and this is 
precious to her 
her toweldry it and braid it up on my head i can 
leans against the wall 
and nothing like myself i say i hug her because i 
first reaping shes about as safe as you can get since 
any tesserae but shes worried about me that the 
i protect prim in every way i can but im powerless 
shes in pain wells up in my chest and threatens to 
 
calm tuck your tail in little duck i say smoothing 
prim giggles and gives me a smallquack 
only prim can draw out of me come on lets eat i 
the fish and greens are already cooking in a stew but 
strawberries and bakery bread for this evenings meal 
prims goat lady and eat the rough bread made from 
anyway 
mandatory unless you are on deaths door this 
this is the case if not youll be imprisoned 
square — one of the few places in district 12 that can 
on public market days especially if theres good 
the bright banners hanging on the buildings theres 
buzzards on rooftops only add to the effect 
good opportunity for the capitol to keep tabs on the 
olds are herded into roped areas marked off by ages 
toward the back family members line up around the 
 
stake or who no longer care who slip among the 
be drawn odds are given on their ages whether 
weep most refuse dealing with the racketeers but 
informers and who hasnt broken the law i could be 
those in charge protect me not everyone can claim 
anyway gale and i agree that if we have to choose 
bullet would be much quicker 
arrive the squares quite large but not enough to 
latecomers are directed to the adjacent streets where 
live by the state 
seam we all exchange terse nods then focus our 
the justice building it holds three chairs a podium 
the girls i stare at the paper slips in the girls ball 
them in careful handwriting 
undersee whos a tall balding man and effie 
with her scary white grin pinkish hair and spring 
with concern at the empty seat 
just as the town clock strikes two the mayor steps 
story every year he tells of the history of panem the 
was once called north america he lists the disasters 
seas that swallowed up so much of the land the 
result was panem a shining capitol ringed by 
to its citizens then came the dark days the uprising 
defeated the thirteenth obliterated the treaty of 
and as our yearly reminder that the dark days must 
the rules of the hunger games are simple in 
districts must provide one girl and one boy called 
be imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that could hold 
over a period of several weeks the competitors must 
taking the kids from our districts forcing them to kill 
way of reminding us how totally we are at their 
another rebellion 
clear look how we take your children and sacrifice 
finger we will destroy every last one of you just as 
 
capitol requires us to treat the hunger games as a 
the others the last tribute alive receives a life of ease 
prizes largely consisting of food all year the capitol 
and even delicacies like sugar while the rest of us 
it is both a time for repentance and a time for 
then he reads the list of past district 12 victors in 
is still alive haymitch abernathy a paunchy middle 
something unintelligible staggers onto the stage and 
responds with its token applause but hes confused 
barely manages to fend off 
televised right now district 12 is the laughingstock of 
attention back to the reaping by introducing effie 
bright and bubbly as ever effie trinket trots to the 
games and may the odds be ever in your favor her 
shifted slightly offcenter since her encounter with 
to be here although everyone knows shes just aching 
proper victors not drunks who molest you in front of 
 
with a ghost of a smile as reapings go this one at 
am thinking of gale and his fortytwo names in that 
not compared to a lot of the boys and maybe hes 
darkens and he turns away but there are still 
its time for the drawing effie trinket says as she 
ball with the girls names she reaches in digs her 
the crowd draws in a collective breath and then you 
desperately hoping that its not me that its not me 
effie trinket crosses back to the podium smoothes 
voice and its not me 
 
motionless for game to wander by i dozed off and fell 
if the impact had knocked every wisp of air from my 
to do anything 
breathe unable to speak totally stunned as the name 
gripping my arm a boy from the seam and i think 
there must have been some mistake this cant be 
her chances of being chosen so remote that id not 
everything taken the tesserae refused to let her do 
had been entirely in her favor but it hadnt mattered 
murmuring unhappily as they always do when a 
this is fair and then i see her the blood drained from 
with stiff small steps up toward the stage passing 
untucked and hangs out over her skirt its this 
brings me back to myself 
my muscles begin to move again prim i dont need 
to shove through the crowd the other kids make way 
i reach her just as she is about to mount the steps 
i volunteer i gasp i volunteer as tribute 
hasnt had a volunteer in decades and the protocol 
name has been pulled from the ball another eligible 
name has been read can step forward to take his or 
reaping is such a great honor people are eager to risk 
district 12 where the wordtribute is pretty much 
but extinct 
small matter of introducing the reaping winner and 
then we um  she trails off unsure herself 
at me with a pained expression on his face he 
there i am the girl who brings the strawberries the 
the girl who five years ago stood huddled with her 
child with a medal of valor a medal for her father 
what does it matter he repeats gruffly let her 
 
wrapped her skinny arms around me like a vice no 
prim let go i say harshly because this is upsetting 
replay of the reapings tonight everyone will make 
a weakling i will give no one that satisfaction let 
i can feel someone pulling her from my back i turn 
thrashing in his arms up you go catnip he says 
carries prim off toward my mother i steel myself and 
well bravo gushes effie trinket thats the spirit 
with a little action going on in it whats your name 
i bet my buttons that was your sister dont want her 
lets give a big round of applause to our newest 
to the everlasting credit of the people of district 12 
betting slips the ones who are usually beyond caring 
knew my father or have encountered prim who no 
applause i stand there unmoving while they take part 
silence which says we do not agree we do not 
 
expect it because i dont think of district 12 as a 
since i stepped up to take prims place and now it 
then another then almost every member of the crowd 
their lips and holds it out to me it is an old and 
at funerals it means thanks it means admiration it 
now i am truly in danger of crying but fortunately 
the stage to congratulate me look at her look at 
shoulders hes surprisingly strong for such a wreck 
long time since hes bathed lots of  he cant 
triumphantly more than you he releases me and 
shouts pointing directly into a camera 
might actually be taunting the capitol ill never 
continue haymitch plummets off the stage and 
hes disgusting but im grateful with every camera 
release the small choked sound in my throat and 
stare into the distance 
for a moment i yearn for something    the idea of us 
 
who else would have volunteered for prim 
trinket is trying to get the ball rolling again what an 
straighten her wig which has listed severely to the 
choose our boy tribute clearly hoping to contain her 
head as she crosses to the ball that contains the boys 
zips back to the podium and i dont even have time to 
peeta mellark 
oh no i think not him because i recognize this 
owner peeta mellark 
as he makes his way toward the stage medium 
waves over 
on his face you can see his struggle to remain 
seen so often in prey yet he climbs steadily onto the 
effie trinket asks for volunteers but no one steps 
them in the bakery but one is probably too old now 
family devotion only goes so far for most people on 
 
treason as he does every year at this point — its 
why him i think then i try to convince myself it 
not even neighbors we dont speak our only real 
forgotten it but i havent and i know i never will  
killed in the mine accident three months earlier in the 
numbness of his loss had passed and the pain would 
body with sobs where are you i would cry out in my 
never any answer 
compensation for his death enough to cover one 
expected to get a job only she didnt she didnt do 
huddled under the blankets on her bed eyes fixed on 
stir get up as if moved by some urgent purpose only 
pleading from prim seemed to affect her 
locked in some dark world of sadness but at the 
but a mother as well at eleven years old with prim 
was no choice i bought our food at the market and 
myself looking presentable because if it had become 
 
placed us in the community home id grown up 
marks of angry hands on their faces the 
could never let that happen to prim sweet tiny prim 
reason who brushed and plaited my mothers hair 
shaving mirror each night because hed hated the 
seam the community home would crush her like a 
but the money ran out and we were slowly starving to 
myself if i could only hold out until may just may 
tesserae and get that precious grain and oil to feed 
well be dead by then 
who hasnt seen the victims older people who cant 
those injured in the mines straggling through the 
motionless against a wall or lying in the meadow you 
are called in to retrieve the body starvation is never 
exposure or pneumonia but that fools no one 
the rain was falling in relentless icy sheets i had 
baby clothes of prims in the public market but there 
several occasions with my father i was too frightened 
to venture into that rough gritty place alone the rain 
leaving me chilled to the bone for three days wed 
mint leaves id found in the back of a cupboard by 
dropped my bundle of baby clothes in a mud puddle 
unable to regain my feet besides no one wanted 
i couldnt go home because at home was my mother 
hollow cheeks and cracked lips i couldnt walk into 
branches i had scavenged at the edge of the woods 
hope 
the shops that serve the wealthiest townspeople the 
essentially in their backyards i remember the 
a goat or two in a pen one sodden dog tied to a post 
all forms of stealing are forbidden in district 12 
there might be something in the trash bins and those 
rotted vegetables at the grocers something no one 
unfortunately the bins had just been emptied 
was so overwhelming i felt dizzy the ovens were in 
kitchen door i stood mesmerized by the heat and the 
luscious scent until the rain interfered running its 
lifted the lid to the bakers trash bin and found it 
suddenly a voice was screaming at me and i looked 
did i want her to call the peacekeepers and how sick 
through her trash the words were ugly and i had no 
away i noticed him a boy with blond hair peering out 
school he was in my year but i didnt know his 
his mother went back into the bakery grumbling but 
behind the pen that held their pig and leaned against 
id have nothing to take home had finally sunk in my 
roots it was too much i was too sick and weak and 
take us to the community home i thought or better 
there was a clatter in the bakery and i heard the 
i vaguely wondered what was going on feet sloshed 
shes coming to drive me away with a stick but it 
large loaves of bread that must have fallen into the 
his mother was yelling feed it to the pig you stupid 
bread 
he began to tear off chunks from the burned parts 
bell rung and the mother disappeared to help a 
the boy never even glanced my way but i was 
red weal that stood out on his cheekbone what had 
my parents never hit us i couldnt even imagine it 
checking that the coast was clear then his attention 
direction the second quickly followed and he 
tightly behind him 
perfect really except for the burned areas did he 
there they were at my feet before anyone could 
under my shirt wrapped the hunting jacket tightly 
bread burned into my skin but i clutched it tighter 
by the time i reached home the loaves had cooled 
dropped them on the table prims hands reached to 
to join us at the table and poured warm tea i 
ate an entire loaf slice by slice it was good hearty 
i put my clothes to dry at the fire crawled into bed 
 
burned the bread on purpose might have dropped 
punished and then delivered them to me but i 
would he have done it he didnt even know me still 
kindness that would have surely resulted in a beating 
we ate slices of bread for breakfast and headed to 
sweet air fluffy clouds at school i passed the boy in 
blackened he was with his friends and didnt 
and started for home that afternoon i found him 
met for only a second then he turned his head away 
saw it the first dandelion of the year a bell went off 
with my father and i knew how we were going to 
to this day i can never shake the connection between 
hope and the dandelion that reminded me that i was 
the school hallway and caught his eyes trained on 
something and i hate owing people maybe if i had 
conflicted now i thought about it a couple of times 
and now it never will because were going to be 
how am i supposed to work in a thankyou in there 
somehow it just wont seem sincere if im trying to slit 
the mayor finishes the dreary treaty of treason and 
solid and warm as those loaves of bread peeta looks 
meant to be a reassuring squeeze maybe its just a 
we turn back to face the crowd as the anthem of 
oh well i think there will be twentyfour of us odds 
of course the odds have not been very dependable of 
 
custody i dont mean were handcuffed or anything 
front door of the justice building maybe tributes 
happen though 
its the richest place ive ever been in with thick deep 
because my mother has a dress with a collar made of 
running my fingers over the fabric repeatedly it helps 
time allotted for the tributes to say goodbye to their 
room with puffy eyes and a red nose crying is not an 
station 
prim and she climbs on my lap her arms around my 
she was a toddler my mother sits beside me and 
nothing then i start telling them all the things they 
do them for them 
theyre careful on selling prims goat milk and cheese 
runs for the people in the seam gale will get her the 
 
with them as i am hell also bring them game — he 
will probably not ask for compensation but they 
or medicine 
teach her a couple of times and it was disastrous the 
shed get teary and talk about how we might be able 
makes out well with her goat so i concentrate on 
when i am done with instructions about fuel and 
and grip her arm hard listen to me are you 
she must know whats coming you cant leave 
my mothers eyes find the floor i know i wont i 
well you have to help it this time you cant clock 
keep you both alive it doesnt matter what happens 
me youll fight through it my voice has risen to a 
abandonment 
herself now i was ill i could have treated myself if 
that part about her being ill might be true ive seen 
 
we cant afford 
ill be all right katniss says prim clasping my face 
so fast and brave maybe you can win 
competition will be far beyond my abilities kids from 
whove been trained their whole lives for this boys 
twenty different ways to kill you with a knife oh 
before the real fun begins 
carry on if ive already given up myself besides it 
when things seem insurmountable then wed be 
i dont care if were rich i just want you to come 
prim 
because of prim ill have to 
time is up and were all hugging one another so hard 
both and theyre saying it back and then the 
bury my head in one of the velvet pillows as if this 
 
im surprised to see its the baker peeta mellarks 
ill be trying to kill his son soon but we do know each 
sells her goat cheeses at the hob she puts two of 
amount of bread in return we always wait to trade 
because hes so much nicer i feel certain he would 
burned bread but why has he come to see me 
plush chairs hes a big broadshouldered man with 
just said goodbye to his son 
and holds it out to me i open it and find cookies 
thank you i say the bakers not a very talkative 
at all i had some of your bread this morning my 
remembering the squirrel not your best trade i say 
then i cant think of anything else so we sit in silence 
coughs to clear his throat ill keep an eye on the 
i feel some of the pressure in my chest lighten at his 
fond of prim maybe there will be enough fondness to 
 
straight to me she is not weepy or evasive instead 
they let you wear one thing from your district in the 
wear this she holds out the circular gold pin that 
to it before but now i see its a small bird in flight 
about the last thing on my mind 
doesnt wait for an answer she just leans in and fixes 
arena katniss she asks promise 
gifts today madge gives me one more a kiss on the 
maybe madge really has been my friend all along 
romantic between us but when he opens his arms i 
me — the way it moves the smell of wood smoke 
moments on a hunt — but this is the first time i 
listen he says getting a knife should be pretty 
thats your best chance 
year there were only horrible spiked maces that the 
 
better than no bow at all 
results its not that easy even he had to scrap his 
i dont even know if therell be wood i say another 
nothing but boulders and sand and scruffy bushes i 
bitten by venomous snakes or went insane from 
theres almost always some wood gale says since 
entertainment in that 
players freeze to death at night you could hardly see 
had no wood for fires or torches or anything it was 
quiet bloodless deaths since then theres usually 
yes theres usually some i say 
know says gale 
say 
practice he says you know how to kill 
 
the awful thing is that if i can forget theyre people it 
the peacekeepers are back too soon and gale asks for 
panic dont let them starve i cry out clinging to 
i wont you know i wont katniss remember i —  he 
111 never know what it was he wanted me to 
its a short ride from the justice building to the train 
ridden in wagons in the seam we travel on foot 
with reporters with their insectlike cameras trained 
wiping my face clean of emotions and i do this now i 
the wall thats airing my arrival live and feel gratified 
peeta mellark on the other hand has obviously been 
trying to cover it up i immediately wonder if this will 
frightened to reassure the other tributes that he is no 
worked very well for a girl johanna mason from 
sniveling cowardly fool that no one bothered about 
it turned out she could kill viciously pretty clever the 
 
years of having enough to eat and hauling bread trays 
it will take an awful lot of weeping to convince anyone 
we have to stand for a few minutes in the doorway of 
then were allowed inside and the doors close 
once 
ive never been on a train as travel between the 
duties for us thats mainly transporting coal but 
speed capitol models that average 250 miles per 
day 
once called the rockies district 12 was in a region 
they mined coal here which is why our miners have 
somehow it all comes back to coal at school besides 
coalrelated except for the weekly lecture on the 
what we owe the capitol i know there must be more 
happened during the rebellion but i dont spend 
dont see how it will help me get food on the table 
justice building we are each given our own 
chambers that have a bedroom a dressing area and 
we dont have hot water at home unless we boil it 
trinket tells me to do anything i want wear anything 
supper in an hour i peel off my mothers blue dress 
before its like being in a summer rain only warmer 
at the last minute i remember madges little gold pin 
someone fashioned a small golden bird and then 
ring only by its wing tips i suddenly recognize it a 
theyre funny birds and something of a slap in the 
bred a series of genetically altered animals as 
or sometimesmuttsfor short one was a special bird 
and repeat whole human conversations they were 
into regions where the capitols enemies were known 
back to centers to be recorded it took people awhile 
private conversations were being transmitted then 
the joke was on it so the centers were shut down and 
only they didnt die off instead the jabberjays mated 
species that could replicate both bird whistles and 
human melodies they had lost the ability to 
human vocal sounds from a childs highpitched 
create songs not just a few notes but whole songs 
them and if they liked your voice 
we went hunting he would whistle or sing 
theyd always sing back not everyone is treated with 
birds in the area would fall silent and listen his voice 
life it made you want to laugh and cry at the same 
practice after he was gone still theres something 
of my father with me protecting me i fasten the pin 
background i can almost imagine the mockingjay 
effie trinket comes to collect me for supper i follow 
room with polished paneled walls theres a table 
mellark sits waiting for us the chair next to him 
wheres haymitch asks effie trinket brightly 
nap says peeta 
i think shes relieved by haymitch s absence and who 
 
green salad lamb chops and mashed potatoes cheese 
effie trinket keeps reminding us to save space 
because ive never had food like this so good and so 
between now and the games is put on a few pounds 
were finishing the main course the pair last year 
savages it completely upset my digestion 
never not one day of their lives had enough to eat 
surely the last thing on their minds peetas a bakers 
yes i can handle a fork and knife but i hate effie 
the rest of my meal with my fingers then i wipe my 
lips tightly together 
down i can see peetas looking a little green too 
if i can hold down greasy saes concoction of mice 
— im determined to hang on to this 
the reapings across panem they try to stagger them 
watch the whole thing live but only people in the 
to attend reapings themselves 
one by one we see the other reapings the names 
often not we examine the faces of the kids who will 
monstrous boy who lunges forward to volunteer from 
district 5 a boy with a crippled foot from district 10 
district 1 1  she has dark brown skin and eyes but 
demeanor only when she mounts the stage and they 
whistling through the decrepit buildings around her 
last of all they show district 12 prim being called 
desperation in my voice as i shove prim behind me as 
away but of course they do hear i see gale pulling 
commentators are not sure what to say about the 
says that district 12 has always been a bit backward 
haymitch falls off the stage and they groan comically 
we shake hands they cut to the anthem again and 
effie trinket is disgruntled about the state her wig 
presentation a lot about televised behavior 
peetahes drunk every year 
trinket makes it sound like haymitch just has 
somewhat rough manners that could be corrected 
yes hisses effie trinket how odd you two find it 
world in these games the one who advises you lines 
any gifts haymitch can well be the difference between 
just then haymitch staggers into the compartment 
vomits all over the expensive carpet and falls in the 
so laugh away says effie trinket she hops in her 
room 
for a few moments peeta and i take in the scene of 
from his stomach the reek of vomit and raw spirits 
obviously haymitch isnt much but effie trinket is 
weve got as if by some unspoken agreement peeta 
to his feet 
his hand on his nose smearing his face with vomit 
you up a bit 
compartment since we cant exactly set him down on 
bathtub and turn the shower on him he hardly 
its okay peeta says to me ill take it from here 
i want to do is strip down haymitch wash the vomit 
peeta is trying to make a good impression on him to 
the state hes in haymitch will have no memory of 
all right i say i can send one of the capitol people 
 
care of us is their job 
i nod and head to my own room i understand how 
people myself but making them deal with haymitch 
the reason why he insists on taking care of haymitch 
kind just as he was kind to give me the bread 
far more dangerous to me than an unkind one kind 
rooting there and i cant let peeta do this not where 
as little as possible to do with the bakers son 
platform to refuel i quickly open the window toss the 
slam the glass shut no more no more of either of 
unfortunately the packet of cookies hits the ground 
track i only see the image for a moment because the 
me of that other dandelion in the school yard years 
i had just turned away from peeta mellarks bruised 
wasnt lost i plucked it carefully and hurried home i 
meadow and yes it was dotted with the golden 
 
until wed filled the bucket with the dandelion greens 
on dandelion salad and the rest of the bakery bread 
find 
remember them 
the apothecary shop the pages were made of old 
neat handwritten blocks told their names where to 
uses but my father added other entries to the book 
wild onions pines prim and i spent the rest of the 
the next day we were off school for a while i hung 
up the courage to go under the fence it was the first 
weapons to protect me but i retrieved the small bow 
probably didnt go more than twenty yards into the 
branches of an old oak hoping for game to come by 
rabbit 
guidance but this id done on my own 
rabbit seemed to stir something in my mother she 
 
gathered then she acted confused and went back to 
bowl 
bit farther into its arms it was slowgoing at first but 
caught fish in nets sometimes managed to shoot a 
plants that sprung up beneath my feet plants are 
youre dead i checked and doublechecked the plants 
any sign of danger a distant howl the inexplicable 
first then i began to risk climbing trees to escape the 
and cats lived deeper in perhaps disliking the sooty 
on may 8th i went to the justice building signed up 
grain and oil in prims toy wagon on the eighth of 
stop hunting and gathering of course the grain was 
buy soap and milk and thread what we didnt 
was frightening to enter that place without my father 
accepted me game was game after all no matter 
wealthier clients in town trying to remember what my 
well the butcher would buy my rabbits but not 
trade for one if his wife wasnt around the head 
peacekeeper loved wild turkey the mayor had a 
in late summer i was washing up in a pond when i 
leaves like arrowheads blossoms with three white 
into the soft mud and i pulled up handfuls of the 
but boiled or baked are as good as any potato 
and i heard my fathers voice joking as long as you 
stirring up the pond bed with my toes and a stick 
night we feasted on fish and katniss roots until we 
slowly my mother returned to us she began to clean 
for winter people traded us or paid money for her 
prim was thrilled to have her back but i kept 
didnt trust her and some small gnarled place inside 
the months she had put us through prim forgave her 
wall to protect myself from needing her and nothing 
now i was going to die without that ever being set 
justice building i had told her i loved her too 
for a while i stand staring out the train window 
 
see the lights of another district 7 10 i dont know 
for bed i imagine my home with its shutters drawn 
were they able to eat supper the fish stew and the 
did they watch the recap of the days events on the 
wall surely there were more tears is my mother 
started to slip away leaving the weight of the world 
prim will undoubtedly sleep with my mother tonight 
himself on the bed to watch over prim comforts me if 
up there until she calms down and falls asleep im so 
imagining my home makes me ache with loneliness 
been eating blackberries only this morning it seems 
into a nightmare maybe if i go to sleep i will wake 
probably the drawers hold any number of nightgowns 
bed in my underwear the sheets are made of soft 
warmth 
morning 111 be able to wash the damage done by the 
too numb to cry the only thing i feel is a desire to be 
somewhere else so i let the train rock me into 
gray light is leaking through the curtains when the 
me to rise up up up its going to be a big big big 
be like inside that womans head what thoughts fill 
night i have no idea 
dirty just slightly crumpled from spending the night 
little gold mockingj ay and i think of the woods and of 
having to get on with things 
the reaping and it doesnt look too bad so i just leave 
capitol now and once we reach the city my stylist 
tonight anyway i just hope i get one who doesnt 
as i enter the dining car effie trinket brushes by me 
under her breath haymitch his face puffy and red 
peeta holds a roll and looks somewhat embarrassed 
the moment i slide into my chair im served an 
potatoes a tureen of fruit sits in ice to keep it chilled 
family going for a week theres an elegant glass of 
 
my father bought one as a special treat a cup of 
almost never afford but it only tastes bitter and thin 
they call it hot chocolate says peeta its good 
shudder runs through me even though the rest of 
cup then i stuff down every mouthful i can hold 
overdo it on the richest stuff one time my mother 
and i said i wont unless i bring it home that shut 
when my stomach feels like its about to split open i 
peeta is still eating breaking off bits of roll and 
much attention to his platter but hes knocking back 
liquid from a bottle judging by the fumes its some 
him often enough in the hob tossing handfuls of 
liquor hell be incoherent by the time we reach the 
i realize i detest haymitch no wonder the district 12 
been underfed and lack training some of our tributes 
we rarely get sponsors and hes a big part of the 
either because theyre betting on them or simply for 
the bragging rights of picking a winner — expect 
so youre supposed to give us advice i say to 
heres some advice stay alive says haymitch and 
peeta before i remember im having nothing more to 
eyes he generally seems so mild 
out at the glass in haymitch s hand it shatters on the 
back of the train only not to us 
peeta in the jaw knocking him from his chair when 
into the table between his hand and the bottle barely 
but it doesnt come instead he sits back and squints 
well whats this says haymitch did i actually get 
peeta rises from the floor and scoops up a handful of 
the red mark on his jaw 
show the audience will think youve mixed it up with 
arena 
 
fought you werent caught even better says 
with that knife besides a table 
fair amount of time throwing knives as well 
its better to get a knife into it too before i approach 
my moment to make an impression i yank the knife 
throw it into the wall across the room i was actually 
the seam between two panels making me look a lot 
stand over here both of you says haymitch 
circles us prodding us like animals at times 
youre not entirely hopeless seem fit and once the 
peeta and i dont question this the hunger games 
always seem to pull more sponsors 
interfere with my drinking and 111 stay sober enough 
exactly what i say 
from ten minutes ago when we had no guide at all 
 
the best strategy at the cornucopia for someone —  
pulling into the station youll be put in the hands of 
you but no matter what it is dont resist says 
but —  i begin 
bottle of spirits from the table and leaves the car as 
there are still a few lights inside but outside its as if 
tunnel that runs up through the mountains into the 
between the capitol and the eastern districts it is 
through the tunnels this geographical advantage was 
to my being a tribute today since the rebels had to 
capitols air forces 
speeds along the tunnel goes on and on and i think 
my chest tightens i hate being encased in stone this 
trapped unable to reach sunlight buried forever in 
the train finally begins to slow and suddenly bright 
peeta and i run to the window to see what weve only 
panem the cameras havent lied about its grandeur 
if anything they have not quite captured the 
of hues that tower into the air the shiny cars that roll 
with bizarre hair and painted faces who have never 
too deep the greens too bright the yellows painful to 
can never afford to buy at the tiny sweet shop in 
the people begin to point at us eagerly as they 
away from the window sickened by their excitement 
holds his ground actually waving and smiling at the 
into the station blocking us from their view 
he says one of them may be rich 
reaping began the friendly squeeze of my hand his 
feed prim    did peeta put him up to that his tears 
then challenging him this morning when apparently 
waving at the window already trying to win the 
all of the pieces are still fitting together but i sense 
he is already fighting hard to stay alive which also 
the bread is fighting hard to kill me 
riiip i grit my teeth as venia a woman with aqua 
strip of fabric from my leg tearing out the hair 
accent youre just so hairy 
do their jaws barely open when they talk why do the 
question odd vowels clipped words and always a 
mimic them 
face good news though this is the last one 
on and nod the final swathe of my leg hair is 
ive been in the remake center for more than three 
has no interest in seeing me until venia and the other 
obvious problems this has included scrubbing down 
dirt but at least three layers of skin turning my nails 
of hair my legs arms torso underarms and parts of 
me like a plucked bird ready for roasting i dont like 
vulnerable but i have kept my side of the bargain 
 
flavius he gives his orange corkscrew locks a shake 
mouth if theres one thing we cant stand its a 
venia and octavia a plump woman whose entire 
down with a lotion that first stings but then soothes 
removing the thin robe ive been allowed to wear off 
circle me wielding tweezers to remove any last bits of 
unlike people that im no more selfconscious than if 
feet 
excellent you almost look like a human being now 
i force my lips up into a smile to show how grateful i 
cause to look nice in district twelve 
dont you poor darling says octavia clasping her 
but dont worry says venia by the time cinna is 
gorgeous 
all the hair and filth youre not horrible at all says 
 
team theyre such total idiots and yet in an odd 
i look at the cold white walls and floor and resist the 
stylist will surely make me remove it at once instead 
my prep team had been told to leave alone my fingers 
arranged my mother i left her blue dress and shoes 
retrieving them of trying to hold on to a piece of her 
the door opens and a young man who must be cinna 
of the stylists they interview on television are so dyed 
but cinnas closecropped hair appears to be its 
and pants the only concession to selfalteration 
applied with a light hand it brings out the flecks of 
the capitol and their hideous fashions i cant help 
hello katniss im cinna your stylist he says in a 
affectations 
just give me a moment all right he asks he walks 
in every inch of it with his eyes i resist the impulse to 
 
its beautiful classic really and in almost perfect 
he says 
trying desperately to look young someone who viewed 
cinna has met none of these expectations 
before i say most of the stylists are familiar 
have been around my whole life 
so they gave you district twelve i say newcomers 
i asked for district twelve he says without further 
well have a chat 
sitting room two red couches face off over a low 
glass providing a window to the city i can see by the 
sunny sky has turned overcast cinna invites me to 
from me he presses a button on the side of the table 
that holds our lunch chicken and chunks of oranges 
white grain tiny green peas and onions rolls shaped 
honey 
i try to imagine assembling this meal myself back 
do with a wild turkey id need to shoot a second 
to substitute for cream we can grow peas in the 
dont recognize the grain our own tessera ration 
rolls would mean another trade with the baker 
i cant even guess whats in it days of hunting and 
a poor substitution for the capitol version 
where food appears at the press of a button how 
woods for sustenance if it were so easy to come by 
besides decorating their bodies and waiting around 
their entertainment 
despicable we must seem to you he says 
thoughts hes right though the whole rotten lot of 
no matter says cinna so katniss about your 
portia is the stylist for your fellow tribute peeta and 
costumes says cinna as you know its customary 
for the opening ceremonies youre supposed to wear 
 
district 3 factories this means that coming from 
miners getup since the baggy miners jumpsuits are 
up in skimpy outfits and hats with headlamps one 
black powder to represent coal dust its always 
crowd i prepare myself for the worst 
wont be indecent 
miner things very overdone no one will remember 
district twelve tributes unforgettable says cinna 
so rather than focus on the coal mining itself were 
covered in black dust i think and what do we do 
youre not afraid of fire are you katniss he sees 
a few hours later i am dressed in what will either be 
opening ceremonies im in a simple black unitard 
boots lace up to my knees but its the fluttering cape 
matching headpiece that define this costume cinna 
into the streets 
its not real flame of course just a little synthetic 
safe he says but im not convinced i wont be 
center 
highlighting here and there my hair has been 
usual style i want the audience to recognize you 
dreamily katniss the girl who was on fire 
demeanor masks a complete madman 
character im actually relieved when he shows up 
about fire being a bakers son and all his stylist 
is absolutely giddy with excitement over what a 
weary as he accepts congratulations 
remake center which is essentially a gigantic stable 
tributes are being loaded into chariots pulled by 
animals are so well trained no one even needs to 
chariot and carefully arrange our body positions the 
each other 
fire 
ill rip off your cape if you 11 rip off mine he says 
deal i say maybe if we can get them off soon 
theyll throw us into the arena no matter what 
wed do exactly what they said but i dont think he 
where is haymitch anyway isnt he supposed to 
with all that alcohol in him its probably not 
and suddenly were both laughing i guess were both 
petrified of being turned into human torches were 
the opening music begins its easy to hear blasted 
revealing the crowdlined streets the ride lasts about 
they will welcome us play the anthem and escort us 
home prison until the games begin 
pulled by snowwhite horses they look so beautiful 
jewels district 1 makes luxury items for the capitol 
favorites 
at all we are approaching the door and i can see that 
 
rolling out when cinna appears with a lighted torch 
he sets our capes on fire i gasp waiting for the heat 
climbs up before us and ignites our headdresses he 
tucks a hand under my chin remember heads high 
cinna jumps off the chariot and has one last idea he 
him out he shouts again and gestures 
look at him and realize that ablaze with the fake 
i think he said for us to hold hands says peeta he 
for confirmation he nods and gives a thumbsup 
the crowds initial alarm at our appearance quickly 
every head is turned our way pulling the focus from 
then i catch sight of us on a large television screen 
deepening twilight the firelight illuminates our faces 
capes cinna was right about the minimal makeup 
remember heads high smiles theyre going to love 
bit higher put on my most winning smile and wave 
for balance he is so steady solid as a rock as i gain 
confidence i actually blow a few kisses to the crowd 
us with flowers shouting our names our first names 
the pounding music the cheers the admiration work 
excitement cinna has given me a great advantage no 
katniss the girl who was on fire 
me surely there must be one sponsor willing to take 
right weapon why should i count myself out of the 
someone throws me a red rose i catch it give it a 
direction of the giver a hundred hands reach up to 
katniss katniss i can hear my name being called 
its not until we enter the city circle that i realize i 
peetas hand thats how tightly ive been holding it i 
but he regains his grip on me no dont let go of me 
please i might fall out of this thing 
feeling strange about the way cinna has linked us 
and then lock us into the arena to kill each other 
the twelve chariots fill the loop of the city circle on 
is packed with the most prestigious citizens of the 
president snows mansion and we come to a halt 
the president a small thin man with paperwhite 
us it is traditional to cut away to the faces of the 
screen that we are getting way more than our share of 
to take your eyes off our flickering when the national 
cut around to each pair of tributes but the camera 
the circle one final time and disappears into the 
the doors have only just shut behind us when were 
unintelligible as they babble out praise as i glance 
shooting us dirty looks which confirms what ive 
cinna and portia are there helping us down from the 
headdresses portia extinguishes them with some 
i realize im still glued to peeta and force my stiff 
thanks for keeping hold of me i was getting a little 
it didnt show i tell him im sure no one noticed 
im sure they didnt notice anything but you you 
you and then he gives me a smile that seems so 
that unexpected warmth rushes through me 
stupid peeta is planning how to kill you i remind 
more likable he is the more deadly he is 
tiptoe and kiss his cheek right on his bruise 
6 
for the tributes and their teams this will be our 
an entire floor you simply step onto an elevator and 
remember 
justice building back in district 12 once to receive 
say my final goodbyes to my friends and family but 
and smells of sour milk the walls of this elevator are 
the ground floor shrink to ants as you shoot up into 
trinket if we can ride it again but somehow that 
apparently effie trinkets duties did not conclude at 
right into the arena in a way thats a plus because at 
places on time whereas we havent seen haymitch 
passed out somewhere effie trinket on the other 
shes ever chaperoned that made a splash at the 
just our costumes but how we conducted ourselves 
anyone in the capitol and has been talking us up all 
 
eyes squint half shut because of course haymitch 
done my best with what i had to work with how 
both successfully struggled to overcome the 
barbarism thats ironic coming from a woman 
basing our success on our table manners 
from the coal district but i said and this was very 
on coal it turns to pearls effie beams at us so 
enthusiastically to her cleverness even though its 
coal doesnt turn to pearls they grow in shellfish 
untrue too ive heard they have some sort of 
diamonds but we dont mine graphite in district 12 
destroyed 
day either know or care 
only haymitch can do that says effie grimly but 
necessary 
has a certain determination i have to admire 
my quarters are larger than our entire house back 
have so many automatic gadgets that im sure i wont 
has a panel with more than a hundred options you 
soaps shampoos scents oils and massaging 
on that blowdry your body instead of struggling with 
box that sends a current through my scalp 
instantly it floats down around my shoulders in a 
i program the closet for an outfit to my taste the 
command you need only whisper a type of food from 
hot and steamy before you in less than a minute i 
bread until theres a knock on the door effies calling 
good im starving 
balcony that overlooks the capitol when we enter the 
after i hear that haymitch will be joining us a meal 
effie and haymitch is bound to be a disaster besides 
our strategies and cinna and portia have already 
a silent young man dressed in a white tunic offers us 
 
stuff my mother uses for coughs and when will i get 
liquid and secretly think it could be improved by a 
haymitch shows up just as dinner is being served it 
and groomed and about as sober as ive ever seen 
starts in on his soup i realize its the first time ive 
together long enough to help us 
haymitch and effie at least theyre addressing each 
for our stylists opening act while they make small 
bitter greens with tomatoes the size of peas rare roast 
cheese that melts on your tongue served with sweet 
white tunics like the one who gave us wine move 
and glasses full 
starts feeling foggy so i change to water instead i 
haymitch can stand walking around like this fulltime 
i try to focus on the talk which has turned to our 
looking cake on the table and deftly lights it it blazes 
awhile until it finally goes out i have a moment of 
 
oh i know you 
certain of it the dark red hair the striking features 
words i feel my insides contracting with anxiety and 
know some bad memory is associated with her the 
my confusion and unease she shakes her head in 
when i look back the four adults are watching me 
dont be ridiculous katniss how could you possibly 
whats an avox i ask stupidly 
tongue so she cant speak says haymitch shes 
her 
them unless its to give an order says effie of 
but i do know her and now that haymitch has 
the disapproval is so high i could never admit it no 
helping 
it is i kept thinking she looked familiar as well then 
 
yellowish hair who looks about as much like our 
the friendliest person on the planet — she smiles 
never seen the girl with the red hair smile but i jump 
who i was thinking of it must be the hair i say 
the energy at the table relaxes oh well if thats all 
all the alcohol has burned off i ordered it specially in 
we eat the cake and move into a sitting room to 
being broadcast a few of the other couples make a 
to us even our own party lets out an ahh as they 
whose idea was the hand holding asks haymitch 
just the perfect touch of rebellion says 
rebellion i have to think about that one a moment 
stiffly apart never touching or acknowledging each 
games had already begun i know what haymitch 
friends has distinguished us as much as the fiery 
 
me for breakfast and ill tell you exactly how i want 
get some sleep while the grownups talk 
rooms when we get to my door he leans against the 
i pay attention to him so delly cartwright imagine 
hes asking for an explanation and im tempted to 
here i am in his debt again if i tell him the truth 
how can it hurt really even if he repeated the story 
witnessed and he lied as much as i did about delly 
i realize i do want to talk to someone about the girl 
story 
see gale again i try to think if telling peeta could give 
how maybe sharing a confidence will actually make 
besides the idea of the girl with her maimed tongue 
to model flashy costumes and eat delicacies but to 
to tell or not to tell my brain still feels slow from the 
decision lies there 
peeta picks up on my hesitation have you been on 
you can practically see the whole city the winds a 
i translate this into no one will overhear us 
might be under surveillance here can we just go 
sure come on says peeta i follow him to a flight of 
shaped room with a door to the outside as we step 
the view the capitol twinkles like a vast field of 
usually we only have it a few hours a day often the 
can count on it is when theyre airing the games or 
that its mandatory to watch but here there would be 
peeta and i walk to a railing at the edge of the roof i 
street which is buzzing with people you can hear 
metallic tinkling in district 12 wed all be thinking 
i asked cinna why they let us up here werent they 
jump right over the side says peeta 
you cant says peeta he holds out his hand into 
 
back on the roof 
cinna has shown peeta the roof i wonder if were 
never seen tributes on the training center roof 
do you think theyre watching us now 
on the other side of the dome theyve built a garden 
hang hundreds of wind chimes which account for the 
night its enough to drown out two people who are 
i pretend to examine a blossom we were hunting in 
whisper 
no my friend gale suddenly all the birds stopped 
warning call and then we saw her im sure it was 
tattered they had dark circles under their eyes from 
on it i say 
of this strange pair clearly not from district 12 
wondered if we could have helped them escape 
moved quickly gale and i were taken by surprise 
yes but were both hunters we know how animals 
as we saw them but we only watched 
to peeta i mean one moment the sky was empty and 
saw it a net dropped down on the girl and carried her 
of spear through the boy it was attached to a cable 
was dead we heard the girl scream once the boys 
vanished into thin air and the birds began to sing 
did they see you peeta asked 
but i do know there was a moment after the 
seen us shed locked eyes with me and called out for 
youre shivering says peeta 
from my body the girls scream had it been her last 
shoulders i start to take a step back but then i let 
and his kindness a friend would do that right 
button at my neck 
i nod theyd had that capitol look about them the 
where do you suppose they were going he asks 
the end of the line beyond us theres only 
that still smolder from the toxic bombs they show it 
they would leave here haymitch had called the 
capitol but they had everything here no cause to 
id leave here peeta blurts out then he looks 
the chimes he laughs id go home now if they let me 
hes covered again if thats all youd heard it would 
someone contemplating the unquestionable goodness 
its getting chilly we better go in he says inside 
conversational your friend gale hes the one who 
yes do you know him i ask 
thought he was your cousin or something you favor 
no were not related i say 
peeta nods unreadable did he come to say goodbye 
yes i say observing him carefully so did your 
peeta raises his eyebrows as if this is news but after 
weight really well he likes you and your sister i 
houseful of boys 
around the dinner table at the bakery fire just in 
have been when the mother was out of the room 
peeta 
grew up in town i say it seems impolite to say she 
bread 
the morning then 
when i open my door the redheaded girl is collecting 
floor before my shower i want to apologize for 
im not supposed to speak to her unless im giving her 
oh sorry i say i was supposed to get those back 
 
the door 
know that my apology runs much deeper that im 
let the capitol kill the boy and mutilate her without 
just like i was watching the games 
clothes the shivering hasnt stopped perhaps the girl 
dont forget the face of the person who was your last 
protect me from the redheaded girl who cant speak 
walls and doors and bedding 
 
my slumbers are filled with disturbing dreams the 
images from earlier hunger games with my mother 
and terrified i bolt up screaming for my father to run 
light 
has a misty haunted air my head aches and i must 
tongue probes the ragged flesh and i taste blood 
arbitrarily punch buttons on the control board and 
icy cold and steaming hot water assault me then im 
a heavy bristled brush oh well at least my blood is 
when im dried and moisturized with lotion i find an 
tight black pants a longsleeved burgundy tunic and 
my back this is the first time since the morning of 
clothes no flaming capes just me looking like i 
haymitch didnt give us an exact time to meet for 
morning but im hungry so i head down to the dining 
 
has been laid with at least twenty dishes a young 
when i ask if i can serve myself he nods assent i 
in thick orange preserves slices of pale purple melon 
capitol i have a second plate of hot grain smothered 
the table breaking oil bits and dipping them into hot 
my mind wanders to my mother and prim they must 
prim milking her goat before school just two 
just two and now how empty the house feels even 
my fiery debut at the games did it give them hope 
of twentyfour tributes circled together knowing only 
haymitch and peeta come in bid me good morning 
wearing exactly the same outfit i am i need to say 
up in out faces once the games begin surely they 
me to do exactly what the stylists tell me to do if it 
him but after last nights triumph i dont have a lot 
im nervous about the training there will be three 
the last afternoon well each get a chance to perform 
meeting the other tributes facetoface makes me 
queasy i turn the roll i have just taken from the 
gone 
he pushes back his plate with a sigh he takes a flask 
his elbows on the table so lets get down to 
separately decide now 
say if you had a secret skill you might not want the 
i exchange a look with peeta i dont have any secret 
right i mean ive eaten enough of your squirrels 
shot somehow i always pictured the baker quietly 
greed but because town families usually eat 
you can coach us together i tell haymitch peeta 
all right so give me some idea of what you can 
i cant do anything says peeta unless you count 
sorry i dont katniss i already know youre handy

i have to think about it ive been putting food on the 
good as my father was but hed had more practice 
hes a genius with traps and snares im all right i 
shes excellent says peeta my father buys her 
never pierce the body she hits every one in the eye 
she can even bring down deer 
totally by surprise first that he ever noticed 
doing i ask him suspiciously 
to know what youre capable of dont underrate 
i dont know why but this rubs me the wrong way 
can lift hundredpound bags of flour i snap at him 
yes and im sure the arena will be full of bags of 
to use a weapon you know it isnt he shoots back 
in our school competition last year only after his 
 
someone wrestle someone to death says peeta in 
theres always handtohand combat all you need is 
chance if i get jumped im dead i can hear my voice 
but you wont youll be living up in some tree eating 
know what my mother said to me when she came to 
district twelve will finally have a winner then i 
out peeta 
she said shes a survivor that onesheis says 
that pulls me up short did his mother really say that 
pain in peetas eyes and know he isnt lying 
chill of the rain running down my back the 
i speak but only because someone helped me 
i know he remembers that day too but he just 
tripping over each other to sponsor you 
 
the effect she can have he runs his fingernail along 
what on earth does he mean people help me when 
except peeta once i had something to barter with 
effect do i have that im weak and needy is he 
me i try to think if this is true perhaps some of the 
always attributed that to their longstanding 
class no one pitied me 
after about a minute of this haymitch says well 
theyll be bows and arrows in the arena but during 
them what you can do until then stay clear of 
i know a few basic snares i mutter 
haymitch and peeta shes right never 
physical power tilts the advantage to a player in the 
reveal how much you can lift in front of the other 
to group training spend the time trying to learn 
mace learn to tie a decent knot save showing what 
clear says haymitch peeta and i nod 
one last thing in public i want you by each others 
object but haymitch slams his hand on the table 
agreed to do as i said you will be together you will 
at the elevator at ten for training 
peeta can hear the door slam i sit on the bed hating 
that day long ago in the rain 
be friends talking up each others strengths 
because in fact at some point were going to have to 
id be prepared to do right now if it wasnt for 
in training its my own fault i guess for telling him 
mean i wanted to do everything with peeta who by 
me either 
effect she can have obviously meant to demean me 
compliment that he meant i was appealing in some 
attention hes paid to my hunting and apparently i 
either the flour the wrestling i have kept track of 
its almost ten i clean my teeth and smooth back my 
nervousness about meeting the other tributes but 
now i can feel my anxiety rising again by the time i 
biting my nails i stop at once 
our building with these elevators the ride is less 
gymnasium filled with various weapons and obstacle 
to arrive the other tributes are gathered in a tense 
district number on it pinned to their shirts while 
assessment peeta and i are the only two dressed 
as soon as we join the circle the head trainer a tall 
explain the training schedule experts in each skill 
from area to area as we choose per our mentors 
skills others fighting techniques we are forbidden to 
tribute there are assistants on hand if we want to 
when atala begins to read down the list of the skill 
other tributes its the first time weve been 
heart sinks almost all of the boys and at least half of 
the tributes have never been fed properly you can see 
eyes i may be smaller naturally but overall my 
area i stand straight and while im thin im strong 
 
healthier body than most of those i see around me 
districts the volunteers the ones who have been fed 
the tributes from 12 and 4 traditionally have this 
train tributes before they reach the capitol but it 
career tributes or just the careers and like as not 
the slight advantage i held coming into the training 
in the presence of my competition the other tributes 
because our stylists were now i see nothing but 
must have fifty to a hundred pounds on me they 
us they head straight for the deadliestlooking 
im thinking that its lucky im a fast runner when 
me per haymitchs instructions his expression is 
i look around at the career tributes who are showing 
others the underfed the incompetent shakily having 
suppose we tie some knots i say 
station where the trainer seems pleased to have 
 
know something about snares he shows us a simple 
dangling by a leg from a tree we concentrate on this 
it then we move on to camouflage peeta genuinely 
mud and clay and berry juices around on his pale 
trainer who runs the camouflage station is full of 
i do the cakes he admits to me 
watching the boy from district 2 send a spear 
cakes 
he means the ones they display in the windows 
frosting theyre for birthdays and new years day 
to admire them although wed never be able to afford 
though so i can hardly deny her this 
alternating pattern of light and dark suggests 
wonder how he knows this since i doubt hes ever 
up from just that scraggly old apple tree in his 
those inaccessible cakes the praise of the camouflage 
 
say 
find in the arena say its actually a gigantic cake —  
say we move on i break in 
quietly from station to station we do pick up some 
to making shelter despite haymitchs order to appear 
sweep the edible plants test without blinking an eye 
wanting to save those for our private sessions 
twenty or so men and women dressed in deep purple 
the gymnasium sometimes wandering about to watch 
endless banquet that has been set for them ignoring 
on the district 12 tributes several times ive looked 
trainers during our meals as well we see them all 
breakfast and dinner are served on our floor but at 
the gymnasium food is arranged on carts around the 
tend to gather rowdily around one table as if to prove 
another and consider the rest of us beneath notice 
one says a word to us peeta and i eat together and 
since haymitch keeps dogging us about it try to keep 
its not easy to find a topic talking of home is 
peeta empties our breadbasket and points out how 
districts along with the refined bread of the capitol 
district 4 the crescent moon roll dotted with seeds 
the same stuff it looks a lot more appetizing than the 
and there you have it says peeta scooping the 
you certainly know a lot i say 
ive said something funny 
the stares from around the room 
talksays peeta its wearing us both out haymitch s 
my door theres been a chill in the air between us 
did i ever tell you about the time i was chased by a 
no but it sounds fascinating says peeta 
story in which id foolishly challenged a black bear 
 
i am 
throwing he whispers to me i think we have a 
i throw my spear which im not too bad at actually if 
from district 1 1 standing back a bit watching us 
so of prim in stature up close she looks about ten 
stands tilted up on her toes with her arms slightly 
slightest sound its impossible not to think of a bird 
her names rue he says softly 
in the meadow rue primrose neither of them could 
what can we do about it i ask him more harshly 
nothing to do he says back just making 
now that i know shes there its hard to ignore the 
like me shes clever with plants climbs swiftly and 
slingshot but what is a slingshot against a 220 
back on the district 12 floor haymitch and effie grill 
 
how the other tributes size up cinna and portia 
the meals not that haymitch and effie are fighting 
determined to whip us into shape full of endless 
training peeta is more patient but i become fed up 
when we finally escape to bed on the second night 
drink 
and a laugh then catch myself its messing with my 
supposedly friends and when were not at least when 
dont dont lets pretend when theres no one 
all right katniss he says tiredly after that we only 
on the third day of training they start to call us out 
gamemakers district by district first the boy then 
last we linger in the dining room unsure where else 
room empties the pressure to appear friendly 
we sit in silence until they summon peeta he rises 
throw the weights the words come out of my mouth 
 
i nod i dont know why i said anything at all 
the others better for our district for my mother and 
after about fifteen minutes they call my name i 
into the gymnasium instantly i know im in trouble 
through twentythree other demonstrations had too 
anything to go home 
walk to the archery station oh the weapons ive 
made of wood and plastic and metal and materials i 
uniform lines i choose a bow string it and sling the 
a shooting range but its much too limited standard 
center of the gymnasium and pick my first target the 
the bow i know something is wrong the strings 
rigid i miss the dummy by a couple of inches and 
a moment im humiliated then i head back to the 
of these new weapons 
position and skewer the dummy right through the 
for boxing and the bag splits open as it slams to the 
 
the hanging lights high above the gymnasium floor a 
its excellent shooting i turn to the gamemakers a 
are fixated on a roast pig that has just arrived at their 
suddenly i am furious that with my life on the line 
me that im being upstaged by a dead pig my heart 
thinking i pull an arrow from my quiver and send it 
alarm as people stumble back the arrow skewers the 
behind it everyone stares at me in disbelief 
a slight bow and walk straight toward the exit without 
 
as i stride toward the elevator i fling my bow to one 
gaping avoxes who guard the elevators and hit the 
together and i zip upward i actually make it back to 
cheeks i can hear the others calling me from the 
bolt the door and fling myself onto my bed then i 
now ive done it now ive ruined everything if id 
that arrow flying at the gamemakers what will they 
tongue and turn me into an avox so i can wait on the 
shooting at the gamemakers of course i wasnt i 
being ignored i wasnt trying to kill one of them if i 
oh what does it matter its not like i was going to 
me what really scares me is what they might do to 
because of my impulsiveness will they take their few 
the community home or kill them they wouldnt kill 
i should have stayed and apologized or laughed like 
 
in the most disrespectful manner possible 
for them to go away and eventually they do it takes 
lay curled up on the bed stroking the silken sheets 
at first i expect guards to come for me but as time 
need a girl tribute from district 12 dont they if the 
publicly wait until im in the arena and sic starving 
dont have a bow and arrow to defend myself 
one in their right mind would sponsor me thats 
open to viewers the gamemakers announce a score 
for the betting that will continue throughout the 
twelve one being irredeemably bad and twelve being 
the mark is not a guarantee of which person will win 
showed in training often because of the variables in 
almost immediately and a few years ago the boy who 
can help or hurt an individual tribute in terms of 
might get me a six or a seven even if im not 
lowest score of the twentyfour if no one sponsors 
 
decide i may as well go the scores will be televised 
i go to the bathroom and wash my face but its still 
everyones waiting at the table even cinna and 
for some reason i dont like the idea of disappointing 
they did on the opening ceremonies without a 
spoonfuls of fish soup the saltiness reminds me of 
the adults begin some chitchat about the weather 
eyebrows a question what happened i just give my 
course i hear haymitch say okay enough small 
peeta jumps in i dont know that it mattered by the 
they were singing some kind of drinking song i 
they told me i could go 
attacked the gamemakers but at least he was 
and you sweetheart says haymitch 
off enough that im at least able to speak i shot an 
 
effies voice confirms my worse suspicions 
direction its like peeta said i was shooting and they 
shot an apple out of their stupid roast pigs mouth i 
and what did they say says cinna carefully 
say 
i dismissed myself i said i remember how i 
like a ton of coal has dropped on me 
roll 
pain to replace you at this stage says haymitch 
them 
theyd have to reveal what happened in the training 
population people would need to know what you did 
effort says haymitch more likely theyll make your 
well theyve already promised to do that to us any 
 
impossible has happened they have actually cheered 
fingers which makes effie frown and dunks it in his 
chuckle what were their faces like 
terrified uh ridiculous some of them an image 
a bowl of punch 
effie although even she is suppressing a smile well 
you and just because you come from district twelve 
around as if shes said something totally 
says to no one in particular 
scores only matter if theyre very good no one pays 
they know you could be hiding your talents to get a 
portia 
probably get says peeta if that really is anything 
heavy ball and throw it a couple of yards one almost 
i grin at him and realize that im starving i cut off a 
eating its okay my family is safe and if they are 
 
announced on television first they show a photo of 
tributes naturally get in the eighttoten range most 
rue comes up with a seven i dont know what she 
been impressive 
eight so at least a couple of the gamemakers must 
palms as my face comes up expecting the worst 
screen 
effie trinket lets out a squeal and everybody is 
congratulating me but it doesnt seem real 
happen i ask haymitch 
a show to put on they need some players with some 
katniss the girl who was on fire says cinna and 
dress more flames i ask of a sort he says 
peeta and i congratulate each other another awkward 
mean for the other i escape to my room as quickly as 
stress of the day particularly the crying has worn me 
out i drift off reprieved relieved and with the 
at dawn i lie in bed for a while watching the sun 
off at home i wonder if gale is in the woods yet 
week rising early hunting and gathering then 
of us can hunt alone but were better as a pair 
the littler things having a partner lightened the load 
familys table enjoyable 
months when i first ran into gale in the woods it was 
dying things id spent the morning competing with 
afternoon wading in shallow ponds harvesting 
had practically run over my toes in its quest for 
snow buried my other food sources having strayed 
lugging my burlap sacks when i came across a dead 
above my head about fifteen yards away was 
my father had used them when the prey is caught 
hungry animals id been trying to use snares all 
my sacks to examine this one my fingers were just on 
out thats dangerous 
i jumped back several feet as gale materialized from 
whole time he was only fourteen but he cleared six 
around the seam and at school and one other time 
in january id stood by while he received his medal 
with no father i remembered his two little brothers 
announced she was just days away from giving birth 
disengaging the rabbit from the snare he had 
katniss i said barely audible 
hadnt you heard he said 
just wanted to look at your snare mine never catch 
he scowled at me not convinced so whered you get 
i shot it i pulled my bow off my shoulder i was still 
id been practicing with the fullsize one when i could 
down some bigger game 
handed it over just remember stealings punishable 
 
transformed him from someone menacing to someone 
before i returned that smile 
get him a bow if he had something to trade not food 
that caught a belt of fat rabbits in one day he agreed 
by we grudgingly began to share our knowledge our 
plums or turkeys he taught me snares and fishing i 
him one of our precious bows and then one day 
dividing the work and the spoils making sure that 
gale gave me a sense of securityldlacked since my 
solitary hours in the woods i became a much better 
constantly when someone was watching my back 
partner he became my confidante someone with 
inside the fence in exchange he trusted me with his 
actually happy 
too casual a word for what gale is to me a pang of 
me now but of course i dont want that i dont want 
just  i just miss him and i hate being so alone 
 
night i know exactly what hed say to me well 
hed give me a smile and id return it without 
i cant help comparing what i have with gale to what 
question gales motives while i do nothing but doubt 
i were thrown together by a mutual need to survive 
death how do you sidestep that 
another big big big day ahead tomorrow night 
team will have their hands full readying us for that 
careful about the buttons i hit and head down to the 
around the table talking in hushed voices that 
load up my plate with breakfast before i join them 
dried plums today perfect on the bed of wild rice ive 
realize no ones talking i take a big gulp of orange 
youre coaching us on interviews today right 
you dont have to wait until im done i can listen 
 
current approach says haymitch 
approach is trying to appear mediocre in front of the 
haymitch shrugs peeta has asked to be coached 
 
ludicrous for there to be betrayal there would have 
trust has not been part of the agreement were 
bread the one who steadied me in the chariot who 
insisted haymitch know my hunting skills    was 
him 
pretense of being friends obviously whatever thin 
and high time too the games begin in two days and 
peetas decision — and i suspect it had to do with my 
but grateful for it maybe hes finally accepted the fact 
enemies the better 
youll each have four hours with effie for 
haymitch you start with effie katniss 
could take four hours but shes got me working down 
me inafulllength gown and highheeled shoes not 
instructs me on walking the shoes are the worst 
part ive never worn high heels and cant get used to 
but effie runs around in them fulltime and im 
poses another problem it keeps tangling around my 
swoops down on me like a hawk smacking my hands 
conquer walking theres still sitting posture — 
contact hand gestures and smiling smiling is 
hundred banal phrases starting with a smile while 
muscles in my cheeks are twitching from overuse 
just remember katniss you want the audience to 
and you dont think they will i ask 
you save that for the arena instead think of yourself 
theyre betting on how long ill live i burst 
well try and pretend snaps effie then she 
smiling at you even though youre aggravating me 
1 kick off my heels and stomp down to the dining 
peeta and haymitch seem in pretty good moods so 
 
wrong after lunch haymitch takes me into the 
frowns at me for a while 
im trying to figure out what to do with you he 
to be charming aloof fierce so far youre shining 
made you look unforgettable youve got the top 
who you are the impression you make tomorrow will 
sponsors says haymitch 
know theres truth to what hes saying if you appeal 
eccentric you gain favor 
ask i say 
naturally says haymitch whereas when you open 
hostile 
please i dont know where you pulled that cheery 
before or since says haymitch 
counter 
but you dont have to please me im not going to 
haymitch delight me 
interviewer and i try to answer his questions in a 
haymitch for what he said and that i even have to 
the whole thing is the hunger games why am i 
people i hate the longer the interview goes on the 
literally spitting out answers at him 
angle not only are you hostile i dont know anything 
no sense of your life your family what you care 
but i dont want them to theyre already taking my 
me in the past i say 
im not good at lying i say 
charm as a dead slug says haymitch 
been too harsh because his voice softens heres an 
humble i echo 
that you cant believe a little girl from district twelve 
you ever could have dreamed of talk about cinnas 
you if you wont talk about yourself at least 
around all right gush 
cannot gush we try me playing cocky but i just dont 
for ferocity im not witty funny sexy or 
by the end of the session i am no one at all 
and a nasty edge has crept into his voice i give up 
let the audience see how openly you despise them 
outrageous number of delicacies eating myself sick 
hunger games at every living being in the capitol by 
the red hair comes in to turn down my bed her eyes 
leave it alone 
that call me a coward a monster a puppet of the 
finally be happening at least my death will help pay 
but instead of fleeing the room the girl closes the 
back with a damp cloth and wipes my face gently 
then cleans the blood from a broken plate off my 
i should have tried to save you i whisper 
stand by that she has forgiven me 
she taps her lips with her fingers then points to my 
up an avox too probably would have an avox or 
i spend the next hour helping the redheaded girl 
dropped down a disposal and the food cleaned away 
like a fiveyearold and let her tuck me in then she 
when i wake up i want the protection of this girl 
in the morning its not the girl but my prep team who 
haymitch are over this day belongs to cinna hes 
wonderful no one will care what comes out of my 
the team works on me until late afternoon turning 
arms painting flame designs on my twenty perfect 
strands of red into a pattern that begins at my left 
braid down my right shoulder they erase my face 
 
throw off bits of light when i blink finally they cover 
in gold dust 
but i cant really see it because its covered close 
i can feel the silken inside as they slip it down over 
pounds i clutch octavias hand as i blindly step into 
lower than the pair effie had me practice in theres 
can i open my eyes i ask 
the creature standing before me in the fulllength 
shimmers and eyes flash and apparently they make 
dress is entirely covered in reflective precious gems 
the tips of the flame design the slightest movement 
i am not pretty i am not beautiful i am as radiant as 
for a while we all just stare at me oh cinna i 
twirl for me he says i hold out my arms and spin 
 
in the dress and shoes which are infinitely more 
way that i dont have to lift the skirt when i walk 
so all ready for the interview then asks cinna i 
haymitch that he knows how dreadful i am 
matter what we tried i couldnt do it i just cant be 
cinna thinks about this a moment why dont you 
myself thats no good either haymitch says im 
well you are  around haymitch says cinna with 
you even won over the gamemakers and as for the 
about you no one can help but admire your spirit 
what it means but it suggests im a fighter in a sort 
maybe i dont go around loving everybody i meet 
for some people 
suppose when you answer the questions you think 
your best friend be asks cinna 
gale i say instantly only it doesnt make sense 
about me he already knows them 
asks cinna 
by far my favorite i liked him right off and he hasnt 
ill be sitting on the main platform with the other 
youre asked a question find me and answer it as 
even if what i think is horrible i ask because it 
especially if what you think is horrible says 
i nod its a plan or at least a straw to grasp at 
a stage constructed in front of the training center 
in front of the crowd the cameras all of panem 
 im completely overcome with stage fright 
just be yourself 
the elevator portia and her gang have been hard at 
accents while we look well together its a relief not to 
be dressed identically haymitch and effie are all 
accept effie s compliments effie can be tiresome and 
when the elevator opens the other tributes are being 
a big arc throughout the interviews ill be last or 
from each district how i wish i could be first and get 
to how witty funny humble fierce and charming 
will start to get bored just as the gamemakers did 
get their attention 
comes up behind peeta and me and growls 
what i thought we abandoned that when peeta 
private not a public thing anyway theres not much 
our seats and take our places 
and shallow i can feel my pulse pounding in my 
between the heels and my legs shaking im afraid ill 
brighter than a summers day an elevated seating 
stylists commanding the front row the cameras will 
handiwork a large balcony off a building to the right 
crews have claimed most of the other balconies but 
the city circle and the avenues that feed into it are 
at homes and community halls around the country 
panem is tuned in there will be no blackouts tonight 
interviews for more than forty years bounces onto the 
been virtually unchanged during all that time same 
hairstyle that he dyes a different color for each 
dotted with a thousand tiny electric bulbs that 
make people appear younger and thinner in district 
so many people die early you see an elderly person 
the secret of survival a plump person is envied 
us but here it is different wrinkles arent desirable 
this year caesars hair is powder blue and his 
freakish but less frightening than he did last year 
bleeding caesar tells a few jokes to warm up the 
the girl tribute from district 1  looking provocative in 
stage to join caesar for her interview you can tell her 
angle for her with that flowing blonde hair emerald 
way 
each interview only lasts three minutes then a 
for caesar he really does his best to make the 
ones at ease laughs at lame jokes and can turn a 
reacts 
districts slip by 2 3 4 everyone seems to be playing 
a ruthless killing machine the foxfaced girl from 
he took his place but even his presence cannot relax 
my palms are sweating like crazy but the jeweled 
dry them 1 1  
with wings flutters her way to caesar a hush falls 
tribute caesars very sweet with her complimenting 
small when he asks her what her greatest strength 
hard to catch she says in a tremulous voice and if 
me out 
encouragingly 
same dark skin as rue but the resemblance stops 
feet tall and built like an ox but i noticed he rejected 
crowd instead hes been very solitary speaking to no 
one showing little interest in training even so he 
impressed the gamemakers he ignores caesars 
just remains silent 
hostile and it would be just fine i bet half the 
money id bet on him myself 
myself as if in a dream standing and making my way 
he has the good grace not to immediately wipe his off 
so katniss the capitol must be quite a change from 
arrived hereasks caesar 
sense 
find cinna in the crowd and lock eyes with him i 
impressed you most since you arrived here i rack 
honest i think be honest 
caesar laughs and vaguely i realize some of the 
the one with the dried plums asks caesar i nod 
the audience in horror hand on his stomach it 
doesnt show does it they shout reassurances to 
he tries to help you out 
came out in the opening ceremonies my heart 
costume 
mean after i got over my fear of being burned alive i 
big laugh a real one from the audience 
cinna my friend i should tellhimanywayi thought 
costume id ever seen and i couldnt believe i was 
lift up my skirt to spread it out i mean look at it 
tiniest circular motion with his finger but i know 
i spin in a circle once and the reaction is immediate 
arms and spin around and around letting the skirt fly 
audience breaks into cheers when i stop i clutch 
dont stop he says 
i have to im dizzy im also giggling which i think 
and the spinning have gotten to me 
worry ive got you cant have you following in your 
everyones hooting as the cameras find haymitch 
reaping and he waves them away goodnaturedly and 
its all right caesar reassures the crowd shes safe 
give us a hint what happened in there 
my lip um  all i can say is i think it was a first 
chuckling and nodding 
pain details details 
it right 
outshes not 
lets go back then to the moment they called your 
is quieter now and you volunteered can you tell us 
 
im imagining the sadness on his face her names 
anything 
what did she say to you after the reaping caesar 
be honest be honest i swallow hard she asked me 
hanging on my every word 
but instead of warmth i feel an icy rigidity take over 
when i speak my voice seems to have dropped an 
i bet you did says caesar giving me a squeeze the 
katniss everdeen tribute from district twelve 
cinna for reassurance he gives me a subtle thumbs 
im still in a daze for the first part of peetas interview 
hear them laughing shouting out he plays up the 
breads from their districts then has a funny 
me do i still smell like roses he asks caesar and 
sniffing each other that brings down the house im 
coming back into focus when caesar asks him if he 
peeta hesitates then gives an unconvincing shake of 
handsome lad like you there must be some special 
peeta sighs well there is this one girl ive had a 
pretty sure she didnt know i was alive until the 
sounds of sympathy from the crowd unrequited love 
she have another fellow asks caesar 
so heres what you do you win you go home she 
encouragingly 
help in my case says peeta 
peeta blushes beet red and stammersout because 
 
the games 
10 
eyes as what he says sinks in then i can see my face 
magnified on every screen as i realize me he means 
hoping this will conceal the emotions starting to boil 
oh that is a piece of bad luck says caesar and 
murmuring in agreement a few have even given 
its not good agrees peeta 
hard not to fall for that young lady says caesar 
peeta shakes his head not until now 
enough to see that the blush on my cheeks is 
wouldnt you love to pull her back out here and get a 
screams assent sadly rules are rules and katniss 
you peeta mellark and i think i speak for all of 
the roar of the crowdis deafening peeta has 
 
settles down he chokes out a quiet thank you and 
to raise my head out of the required respect and 
dominated by a shot of peeta and me separated by a 
breached poor tragic us 
after the anthem the tributes file back into the 
sure to veer into a car that does not contain peeta 
mentors and chaperones so we have only each other 
deposit four tributes before i am alone and then find 
just stepped from his car when i slam my palms into 
ugly urn filled with fake flowers the urn tips and 
the shards and blood immediately flows from his 
what was that for he says aghast 
about me i shout at him 
effie haymitch cinna and portia 
voice did you fall 
help him up 
haymitch turns on me shoved him 
kind of fool in front of the entire country i answer 
spikes of pottery from his palms haymitch just 
yes haymitch is very helpful to you i say 
think he hurt you that boy just gave you something 
he made me look weak i say 
use all the help you can get in that department you 
wanted you now they all do youre all theyre talking 
says haymitch 
haymitch grabs my shoulders and pins me against 
youre perceived the most i could say about you after 
although that in itself was a small miracle now i can 
back home fall longingly at your feet which do you 
the smell of wine on his breath makes me sick i 
trying to clear my head 
cinna comes over and puts his arm around me hes 
i dont know what to think i should have been told 
no your reaction was perfect if youd known it 
shes just worried about her boyfriend says peeta 
my cheeks burn again at the thought of gale i dont 
whatever says peeta but i bet hes smart enough 
say you loved me so what does it matter 
now between thinking ive been used and thinking ive 
interview but what was i really a silly girl spinning 
any substance i hail was when i talked about prim 
and im forgettable silly and sparkly and forgettable 
training 
just his to hear him tell it i have many admirers 
remember howstrongly they responded to his 
they eat that stuff up in the capitol suddenly im 
 
love with him too i ask 
the cameras the blush 
youre golden sweetheart youre going to have 
im embarrassed about my reaction i force myself to 
doesnt matter he shrugs although its technically 
are your hands okay i ask theyh be all right he 
in the silence that follows delicious smells of our 
eat says haymitch we all follow him to the table 
heavily and portia leads him off for medical 
without them by the time weve finished theyre 
help feeling guilty tomorrow we will be in the arena 
injury will i never stop owing him 
i seem frilly and shallow twirling and giggling in my 
peeta actually is charming and then utterly winning 
confused madebeautiful by cinnas hands desirable 
by peetas confession tragic by circumstance and by 
when the anthem finishes and the screen goes dark 
be roused and prepared for the arena the actual 
capitol residents rise late but peeta and i must make 
travel to the arena that has been prepared for this 
i know haymitch and effie will not be going with us 
headquarters hopefully madly signing up our 
deliver the gifts to us cinna and portia will travel 
launched into the arena still final goodbyes must be 
effie takes both of us by the hand and with actual 
the best tributes it has ever been her privilege to 
apparently required by law to say something awful 
promoted to a decent district next year 
out overcome with either the emotional parting or the 
haymitch crosses his arms and looks us both over 
when the gong sounds get the hell out of there 
 
you can between yourselves and the others and find 
and after that i ask 
gave us on the train but hes not drunk and laughing 
when i head to my room peeta lingers to talk to 
exchange can wait until tomorrow my covers are 
avox girl i wish i knew her name i should have 
but perhaps that would only result in punishment for 
i take a shower and scrub the gold paint the 
remains of the designteams efforts are the flames on 
am to the audience katniss the girl who was on fire 
days to come 
it takes me about five seconds to realize ill never fall 
arena every moment i give in to fatigue will be an 
its no good one hour two three pass and my 
imagine exactly what terrain ill be thrown into 
hoping for trees which may afford me some means of 
 
games resolve too quickly without them but what 
gamemakers hid den to liven up the slower 
the more anxious i am to find sleep the more it 
bed i pace the floor heart beating too fast breathing 
get air soon im going to start to throw things again i 
unlocked but ajar perhaps someone forgot to close it 
roof prevents any desperate form of escape and im 
want to see the sky and the moon on the last night 
the roof is not lit at night but as soon as my bare feel 
against the lights that shine endlessly in the capitol 
streets music and singing and car horns none of 
panels in my room i could slip away now without 
but the night airs so sweet i cant bear returning to 
make whether we speak or not 
yard behind him when i say you should be getting 
he starts but doesnt turn i can see him give his 
its for us after all 
i come up beside him and lean over the edge of the 
squint to make out their tiny figures in more detail 
who could tell peeta answers with all the crazy 
couldnt turn my mind off i say 
no i admit a bit guiltily all i can do is wonder 
light from below i can see his face now the awkward 
about your hands 
a contender in these games anyway 
why not its true my best hope is to not disgrace 
and what i say 
die as myself does that make any sense he asks i 
himself i dont want them to change me in there 
i bite my lip feeling inferior while ive been 
struggling with how to maintain his identity his 
ask 
no when the time comes im sure ill kill just like 
keep wishing i could think of a way to  to show the 
piece in their games says peeta 
the games work 
theres still me he insists dont you see 
say 
this point he asks angrily hes locked those blue 
i take a step back care about what haymitch said 
peeta smiles at me sad and mocking okay thanks 
its like a slap in the face his use of haymitchs 
the last hours of your life planning some noble death 
in district twelve 
my mother my best when you make it back will you 
spend the rest of the night slipping in and out of a 
peeta mellark in the morning peeta mellark we will 
 
raging beast tributes the kind who tries to eat 
guy like that a few years ago from district 6 called 
gamemakers had to have him stunned with electric 
before he ate them there are no rules in the arena 
audience so they tried to head it off there was some 
out was specifically engineered to ensure the victor 
i dont see peeta in the morning cinna comes to me 
guides me to the roof my final dressing and 
arena itself a hovercraft appears out of thin air just 
redheaded avox girl captured and a ladder drops 
and instantly its as if im frozen some sort of current 
i expect the ladder to release me then but im still 
carrying a syringe this is just your tracker katniss 
she says 
feeling the sharp stab of pain as the needle inserts 
inside of my forearm now the gamemakers will 
wouldnt want to lose a tribute 
as soon as the trackers in place the ladder releases 
from the roof an avox boy comes in and directs us to 
tension in my stomachieat as much as i can 
impression on me im so nervous i could be eating 
view from the windows as we sail over the city and 
only theyre free and safe the very opposite of me 
black out suggesting that were nearing the arena 
ladder only this time it leads down into a tube 
arena we follow instructions to my destination a 
it the launch room in the districts its referred to as 
everything is brandnew i will be the first and only 
historic sites preserved after the games popular 
go for a month rewatch the games tour the 
place you can even take part in reenactments they 
i struggle to keep my breakfast down as i shower and 
trademark braid down my back then the clothes 
say in my outfit does not even know what will be in 
undergarments simple tawny pants light green 
 
jackets designed to reflect body heat expect some 
the boots worn over skintight socks are better than i 
at home these have a narrow flexible rubber sole 
i think im finished when cinna pulls the gold 
forgotten about it 
off the green outfit you wore on the train he says i 
pinning it to the shirt its your district token right 
the review board some thought the pin could be used 
eventually they let it through says cinna they 
if you twisted the gemstone a spike popped out 
ring transformed and there was no way to prove she 
around make sure everything feels comfortable 
fine fits perfectly 
cinna unless you think you could eat any more 
take tiny sips of as we wait on a couch i dont want 
on the inside of my cheek it still hasnt fully healed 
from a few days ago soon the taste of blood fills my 
nervousness seeps into terror as i anticipate what is 
not even my fingers obsessively trace the hard little 
tracking device i press on it even though it hurts i 
do you want to talk katniss cinna asks 
hand to him cinna encloses it in both of his and 
announces its time to prepare for launch 
stand on the circular metal plate remember what 
he says i nod and remember this im not allowed to 
truly i whisper 
the forehead good luck girl on fire and then a 
handhold cutting him off from me he taps his 
i lift my chin and stand as straight as i can the 
in darkness and then i can feel the metal plate 
a moment my eyes are dazzled by the bright sunlight 
hopeful smell of pine trees 
then i hear the legendary announcer claudius 
ladies and gentlemen let the seventyfourth hunger 
 
on our metal circles before the sound of a gong 
mines blow your legs off sixty seconds to take in the 
giant golden horn shaped like a cone with a curved 
spilling over with the things that will give us life here 
medicine garments fire starters strewn around the 
the farther they are from the horn for instance only 
plastic certainly it could be of some use in a 
pack that would protect from almost any sort of 
against the other twenty three tributes which i have 
were on a flat open stretch of ground a plain of 
i can see nothing indicating either a steep downward 
and back spars piney woods this is where haymitch 
i hear his instructions in my head just clear out 
and the others and find a source of water 
waiting there before me and i know that if i dont get 
 
sustaining spoils something catches my eye there 
of arrows and a bow already strung just waiting to 
im fast i can sprint faster than any of the girls in our 
races but this forty yard length this is what i am 
first but then the question is how quickly can i get 
and grabbed the weapons others will have reached 
but say theres a dozen at that close range they 
their own powerful fists 
the other tributes would pass up a smaller girl even 
more fierce adversaries 
hed tell me to go for it get the weapon since thats 
only see one bow in that whole pile i know the 
what my strategy will be and i find myself positioning 
but toward the pile toward the bow when suddenly i 
a fair distance still i can tell hes looking at me and i 
my eyes and while im puzzling over it the gong rings 
and ive missed it ive missed my chance because 
 
my feet shuffle for a moment confused at the 
forward scoop up the sheet of plastic and a loaf of 
with peeta for distracting me that i sprint in twenty 
hold anything because i cant stand leaving with 
a boy i think from district 9 reaches the pack at the 
and then he coughs splattering my face with blood i 
then the boy slips to the ground thats when i see 
reached the cornucopia and are spreading out to 
running toward me one hand clutching a halfdozen 
misses and im her next target 
immediate fear of this girl this predator who might 
i sling the pack over one shoulder and run full speed 
me and reflexively hike the pack up to protect my 
my shoulders now i make for the trees somehow i 
back into the cornucopia before all the good stuff is 
think 
survey the field about a dozen or so tributes are 
dead already on the ground those who have taken 
flight are disappearing into the trees or into the void 
hidden me from the other tributes then slow into a 
the next few hours i alternate between jogging and 
myself and my competitors i lost my bread during 
to stuff my plastic in my sleeve so as i walk i fold it 
— its a fine one with a long sharp blade serrated 
through things — and slide it into my belt i dont 
just keep moving pausing only to check for pursuers 
woods but i will need water that was haymitchs 
first i keep a sharp eye out for any sign of it no luck 
intermixed with a variety of trees some i recognize 
noise and pull my knife thinking i may have to 
see you i whisper if theres one rabbit there could 
the ground slopes down i dont particularly like this 
in the hills around district 12 where i can see my 
keep going 
gorging myself have paid off ive got staying power 
rejuvenating im glad for the solitude even though 
its an illusion because im probably onscreen right 
many deaths to show the first day that a tribute 
they 11 show me enough to let people know im alive 
of betting is the opening when the initial casualties 
the field shrinks to a handful of players 
each shot represents a dead tribute the fighting 
never collect the bloodbath bodies until the killers 
fire the cannons until the initial fightings over 
allow myself to pause panting as i count the shots 
eleven eleven dead in all thirteen left to play my 
district 9 coughed into my face hes gone certainly i 
ill know in a few hours when they project the deads 
all of a sudden im overwhelmed by the thought that 
in the process of being transported back to the 
simple wooden box back to district 12 no longer 
him once the action started but the last image i can 
out 
confidence he could win and i will not end up with 
the unpleasant task of killing him maybe its better if 
i slump down next to my pack exhausted i need to 
have to work with as i unhook the straps i can feel 
color this orange will practically glow in the dark i 
tomorrow 
moment is water haymitchs directive to immediately 
it for a few days 111 be able to function with 
ill deteriorate into helplessness and be dead in a 
black sleeping bag that reflects body heal a pack of 
iodine a box of wooden matches a small coil of wire 
with a cap for carrying water thats bone dry 
up the bottle i become aware of the dryness in my 
moving all day long its been hot and ive sweat a lot 
drink from or snow to melt if it should come to it 
the one i saw while i was waiting for the gong to 
arena that way theyll guarantee drawing us in to 
now a much harder journey with nothing to drink 
guarded by some of the career tributes im about to 
panic when i remember the rabbit i startled earlier 
where 
are too thin to offer much concealment the layer of 
tracking animals harder when i need their trails to 
deeper into a valley that seems endless 
precious store of crackers and beef yet instead i take 
the outer bark and scraping off a large handful of the 
along after a week of the finest food in the world its 
pine in my life ill adjust quickly 
camp night creatures are coming out i can hear the 
competing with natural predators for the rabbits as 
soon to tell there could be any number of animals 
but right now i decide to make my fellow tributes a 
the night those who fought it out at the cornucopia 
torches or flashlights and weapons theyre itching to 
to be out of range 
twitchup snares in the brush i know its risky to be 
 
minutes before making camp 
set in a clump of other willows offering concealment 
the stronger branches close to the trunk and find a 
arrange the sleeping bag in a relatively comfortable 
then slide in after it as a precaution i remove my 
sleeping bag and refasten it at my waist now if i roll 
im small enough to tuck the top of the bag over my 
air is cooling quickly despite the risk i took in getting 
this sleeping bag radiating back and preserving my 
several other tributes whose biggest concern right 
able to get a few hours of sleep if only i wasnt so 
night has just come when i hear the anthem that 
see the seal of the capitol which appears to be 
screen an enormous one thats transported by of one 
out and the sky goes dark for a moment at home we 
killing but thats thought to give an unfair advantage 
on the bow and shot someone my secret would be 
the same photographs they showed when they 
 
i take a deep breath as the face of the eleven dead 
fingers 
means that the career tributes from 1 and 2 have all 
didnt expect that one usually all the careers make it 
guess the foxfaced girl made it both tributes from 6 
boy who i fought for the backpack ive run through 
peeta no theres the girl from district 10 thats it 
then darkness and the sounds of the forest resume 
get killed his winning will benefit my mother and 
conflicting emotions that arise when i think of peeta 
his love for me in the interview the anger at his 
facetoface at any moment in this arena 
out who is left five career tributes foxface thresh 
after all i cant help feeling glad that makes ten of 
it is dark and i have traveled far and i am nestled 
i havent really slept in two days and then theres 
allow my muscles to relax my eyes to close the last 
 
how long have i been asleep four hours five the 
on this is not the sound of a branch under 
from a tree snap snap i judge it to be several 
myself in that direction for a few minutes theres 
a spark and a small fire begins to bloom a pair of 
than that 
know at the fire starter what are they thinking a 
those who battled at the cornucopia with their 
couldnt possibly have been near enough to spot the 
combing the woods for hours looking for victims you 
and get me 
in the games strapped in a tree not daring to flee 
any killer who cares i mean i know its cold out here 
grit your teeth and stick it out until dawn 
hours really thinking that if i can get out of this tree i 
neighbor my instinct has been to flee not fight but 
dangerous and this one probably doesnt have much 
knife 
the sky is still dark but i can feel the first signs of 
meaning the person whose death im now devising 
then i hear it several pairs of feet breaking into a 
her before she can escape i know its a girl now i can 
then theres laughter and congratulations from 
eleven to go which gets a round of appreciative 
so theyre fighting in a pack im not really surprised 
games the strong band together to hunt down the 
to turn on one another i dont have to wonder too 
remaining career tributes from districts 12 and 4 
together 
supplies i can tell by their comments theyve found 
quickly dismiss the thought shes much too bright to 
better clear out so they can get the body before it 
boy from district 2 there are murmurs of assent and 
me they do not know im here how could they and 
the sun stays down then my black sleeping bag will 
moving they will pass me and be gone in a minute 
but the careers stop in the clearing about ten yards 
an arm here a boot there through the breaks in the 
have they spotted me no not yet i can tell from 
shouldnt we have heard a cannon by now 
immediately 
shes dead i stuck her myself 
someone should go back make sure the jobs done 
twice 
an argument breaks out until one tribute silences the 
move on 
peeta 
thank goodness i had the foresight to belt myself in 
ground held in place by the belt one hand and my 
braced against the trunk there must have been some 
been too caught up in their own argument to catch it 
2 see for yourself 
back to the girl by the fire his face is swollen with 
from the sound of his gait hes limping somewhat i 
to go into the fight for the supplies when all along all 
things just the opposite of what haymitch had mid 
okay i can stomach that seeing all those supplies 
teaming up with the career wolf pack to hunt down 
doing such a thing career tributes are overly vicious 
capitols lapdogs 
own districts i can imagine the things theyre saying 
talk to me about disgrace 
obviously the noble boy on the rooftop was playing 
i will eagerly watch the night skies for signs of his 
the career tributes are silent until he gets out of ear 
why dont we just kill him now and get it over with 
with that knife 
im learning about my friend peeta today 
it takes me a moment to register that the her theyre 
why you think she bought into that sappy romance 
she might have seemed pretty simpleminded to me 
dress i want to puke 
bet you lover boy knows 
was she dead asks the boy from district 2 
cannon fires ready to move on 
the career pack sets off at a run just as dawn begins 
awkward position muscles trembling with exertion 
branch i need to get down to get going but for a 
is peeta with the careers hes helping them find me 
because of her eleven because she can use a bow 
but he hasnt told them yet is he saving that 
alive is he still pretending to love me for the 
suddenly the birds fall silent then one gives a high 
gale and i heard when the redheaded avox girl was 
materializes a set of huge metal teeth drops down 
hovercraft then it vanishes the birds resume their 
move i whisper to myself i wriggle out of my 
a deep breath while ive been concealed by darkness 
probably been difficult for the cameras to get a good 
though the minute i hit the ground im guaranteed 
the audience will have been beside themselves 
careers talking that i discovered peeta was with 
 
certainly not confused or frightened 
so as i slide out of the foliage and into the dawn light 
me then i cock my head slightly to the side and give 
means 
maybe its imprudent to check them with the others 
guess and the lure of possible meat im rewarded 
gutted the animal leaving the head feet tail skin 
fire — eating raw rabbit can give you rabbit fever a 
dead tribute i hurry back to her camp sure enough 
rabbit fashion a spit out of branches and set it over 
im glad for the cameras now i want sponsors to see i 
into traps as easily as the others will by hunger 
branch and set about camouflaging my orange pack 
would definitely help of course to have mud id 
i pull on my gear grab my spit kick some dirt over 
careers went i eat half the rabbit as i go then wrap 
 
quench my thirst water is my top priority now 
screen in the capitol so im careful to continue to 
templesmith must be having with his guest 
reaction what to make of it all has peeta revealed 
will we lose sponsors do we even have sponsors 
certainly peeta has thrown a wrench into our star 
hasnt spoken much about me we can still get some 
something we plotted together if i seem like it amuses 
the sun rises in the sky and even through the canopy 
from the rabbit and try to keep from panting but its 
i try and think of everything i know about finding 
into this valley isnt a bad thing if i could just locate 
vegetation these might help me along but nothing 
the birds the sameness to the trees 
what little urine ive been able to pass is a dark 
my tongue that refuses to moisten the sun hurts my 
on they do something funny to my vision so i just 
 
a cluster of berry bushes and hurry to strip the fruit 
im holding them to my lips i get a hard look at them 
different shape and when i break one open the 
perhaps they are edible but im guessing this is some 
plant instructor in the training center made a point 
percent sure they werent toxic something i already 
me the strength to fling them away 
usual tiredness that follows a long hike i have to stop 
what ails me requires continued searching i try a 
shaky state — to look for any signs of water but as 
unrelenting stretch of forest 
stumbling over my own feet 
myself in ive no appetite but i suck on a rabbit bone 
the anthem plays and high in the sky i see the 
8 the one peeta went back to finish off 
burning thirst besides they were heading away from 
scarcity of water they may even have had to return to 
 
morning brings distress my heads throbs with every 
pain through my joints i fall rather than jump from 
my gear somewhere inside me i know this is wrong 
more urgency but my mind seems foggy and forming 
tree one finger gingerly stroking the sandpaper 
can i get water 
hope for rain theres not a cloud in the sky 
another thought hits me and the surge of anger that 
haymitch he could send me water press a button 
minutes i know i must have sponsors at least one or 
pricey but these people theyre made of money and 
doesnt realize how deep my need is 
hopefully for a parachute to descend from the sky 
something is wrong am i deluded about having 
hang back no i dont believe it theres someone out 
refusing to let it go through as my mentor he gets to 
control the flow of gifts from the sponsors i know he 
to let me die from this he cant do that can he if 
accountable by the viewers by the people back in 
he say what you will about my fellow traders in the 
if he let me die this way and then where would he get 
for defying him is he directing all the sponsors 
whats going on at the moment somehow i dont 
off by neglect either he has in fact in his own 
for this then what is going on 
tears now i couldnt produce one to save my life 
and suspicions a small voice in the back of my head 
maybe hes sending you a message it says a 
good reason haymitch could be withholding water 
i grit my teeth and pull myself to my feet my 
broken branch that will do for a walking stick and i 
than the first two days i feel like an old piece of 
an effort but i refuse to stop i refuse to sit down if i 
again that i wont even remember my task 
what easy prey i am any tribute even tiny rue 
kill me with my own knife and id have little strength 
they ignore me the truth is i feel a million miles 
not alone though no theyve surely got a camera 
watching tributes starve freeze bleed and dehydrate 
somewhere im being featured 
watching me live but theyll show updates at the 
least desperate as i can 
are shaking and my heart too quick i keep forgetting 
managed to regain my feet but when the stick slides 
unable to get up i let my eyes close 
helping me at all 
air is less hot signifying evenings approach theres 
fingers stroke the smooth ground sliding easily 
my fingertips make small swirling patterns in the 
times ive tracked game with the help of its soft 
mud my eyes fly open and i dig my fingers into the 
earth it is mud my nose lifts in the air and those 
i crawl now through the mud dragging myself 
through a tangle of plants into a pond floating on 
lilies 
and gulp down as much as i can hold but i have jus 
get out my flask and fill it with water i add what i 
for purifying it the half an hour of waiting is agony 
i think its a half an hour but its certainly as long as 
slowly easy now i tell myself i take one swallow and 
of hours i drink the entire half gallon then a second 
continue sipping eating rabbit and even indulge in 
plays i feel remarkably better there are no faces 
here resting camouflaging my backpack with mud 
digging up the roots of the pond lilies to make a nice 
to my water bottle for dear life which of course it is 
from slumber i look around in bewilderment its not 
 
me 
my first impulse is to scramble from the tree but im 
buckle and i fall to the ground in a heap still snarled 
packing fortunately my backpack and water bottle 
bag over my shoulder and flee 
burning branches crack from trees and fall in 
others the rabbits and deer and i even spot a wild 
sense of direction because their instincts are sharper 
the underbrush so gracefully as my boots catch on 
keep apace with them 
smoke which threatens to suffocate me at any 
grateful to find it soaked in sweat and it offers a thin 
against my back my face cut with branches that 
because i know i am supposed to run 
accidental occurrence the flames that bear down on 
marks them as humanmade machinemade 
no deaths perhaps no fights at all the audience in 
 
the games must not do 
there is the career pack and then there are the rest 
this fire is designed to flush us out to drive us 
seen but its very very effective 
end of my jacket catches on fire and i have to stop to 
dont dare leave the jacket scorched and smoldering 
bag hoping the lack of air will quell what i havent 
back and its little enough to survive with 
burning the coughing begins soon after and my 
cooked discomfort turns to distress until each breath 
take cover under a stone outcropping just as the 
whatever water has remained in my stomach 
theres nothing left to come up 
lightheaded now gasping for air i allow myself about 
take a few swallows from my bottle you get one 
time to reorder my supplies wad up the sleeping bag 
minutes up i know its time to move on but the 
 
know i havent been in this part of the woods before 
against on my earlier travels where are the 
whole new terrain filled with new dangers i had just 
attack began would there be any way i could travel 
source of water at least the wall of fire must have an 
gamemakers couldnt keep it fueled but because 
the audience if i could get back behind the fire line i 
decided to try and loop back around although it will 
a very circuitous route back when the first fireball 
spring out from under my ledge energized by renewed 
the game has taken a twist the fire was just to get 
fun when i hear the next hiss i flatten on the 
tree off to my left engulfing it in flames to remain 
ball hits the ground where i was lying sending a 
as i frantically try to dodge the attacks i cant see 
hovercraft the angles are not extreme enough 
armed with precision launchers that are concealed in 
room a gamemaker sits at a set of controls fingers 
that is needed is a direct hit 
whatever vague plan i had conceived regarding 
zigzag and dive and leap to avoid the fireballs each 
tremendous power on contact every sense i have 
theres no time to judge if a move is the correct one 
something keeps me moving forward though a 
that certain areas of the arena are rigged for certain 
section i might be able to move out of reach of the 
vipers but i cant worry about that now 
say but the attacks finally begin to abate which is 
acidic substance that scalds my throat and makes its 
body convulses trying desperately to rid itself of the 
for the next hiss the next signal to bolt it doesnt 
out of my stinging eyes my clothes are drenched in 
pick up the scent of singed hair my hand fumbles to 
six inches of it strands of blackened hair crumble in 
transformation when the hissing registers 
fireball crashes into the ground at my side but not 
leg on fire sends me over the edge i twist and scuttle 
 
enough sense i roll the leg back and forth on the 
without thinking i rip away the remaining fabric with 
i sit on the ground a few yards from the blaze set off 
covered in red welts im shaking too hard to move if 
time 
and sparkling gems katniss the girl who was on 
having over that one perhaps cinnas beautiful 
torture for me i know he couldnt have foreseen this 
cares about me but all in all maybe showing up 
me 
me dead not yet anyway everyone knows they could 
real sport of the hunger games is watching the 
tribute just to remind the players they can but 
another facetoface which means if i am no longer 
at hand 
could but the smoke is still thick enough to kill me i 
wall of flames that lights up the sky it does not seem 
to be pursuing me any longer except with its stinking 
another light daylight begins to softly emerge swirls 
can see maybe fifteen yards in any direction a tribute 
my knife as a precaution but i doubt my ability to 
compete with that in my calf i hate burns have 
pulling a pan of bread from the oven it is the worst 
anything like this 
im ankledeep its springfed bubbling up out of a 
hands into the shallow water and feel instant relief 
treatment for a burn is cold water that it draws out 
recommend it for my hands but what of my calf 
it im guessing that its an injury in a whole different 
i lie on my stomach at edge of the pool for a while 
flames on my fingernails that are beginning to chip 
i bathe the blood and ash from my face i try to recall 
the seam where we cook and heat our homes with 
once brought in an unconscious young man pleading 
responsible for treating the miners had written him 
off told the family to take him home to die but they 
senseless to the world i got a glimpse of the wound 
down to the bone before i ran from the house i went 
the gruesome leg memories of my fathers death 
shadow stayed and helped my mother says healers 
died just like the doctor said he would 
it what if its as bad as the mans and i can see my 
burns severe the victim might not even feel pain 
by this i sit up and swing my leg in front of me 
brilliant red covered with blisters i force myself to 
cameras are on my face i cant show weakness at this 
admiration at your refusal to give in does i cut the 
the injury more closely the burned area is about the 
think its not too bad to soak gingerly i stretch out 
a rock so the leather doesnt get too sodden and sigh 
herbs if i could find them that would speed the 
and time will probably be all i have to work with 
but still too heavy to be healthy if i do continue away 
 
leg from the water the pain rebounds so intensely i 
demanding they can handle small breaks from the 
my bottle with the pool water treat it and when 
after a time i force myself to nibble on a cracker 
bag except for a few black marks its relatively 
scorched at least a foot of the back beyond repair i 
that comes just to the bottom of my ribs but the 
despite the pain drowsiness begins to take over id 
spot besides abandoning my pool seems impossible 
my shoulders but i cant seem to leave i spot some 
with my last piece of rabbit sip water watch the sun 
anyway that is any safer than here i lean back on 
want me let them find me i think before drifting into 
and find me they do its lucky im ready to move on 
minute head start evening has begun to fall the 
across the pool flying into the underbrush my leg 
speedy as they were before the fire either i hear their 
 
and so i do what i have done my whole life in such 
if running hurt climbing is agonizing because it 
hands on the tree bark im fast though and by the 
feet up for a moment we stop and survey one 
heart 
against them all six are there the five careers and 
up too even so look at their weapons look at their 
them it seems pretty hopeless but then something 
no doubt but theyre also heavier theres a reason 
highest fruit or rob the most remote bird nests i 
smallest career 
cheerfully 
it 
2 yourself 
hear the laughter from the capitol the airs better 
think i will says the same boy 
here take this cato says the girl from district 1 
arrows my bow my arrows just the sight of them 
that traitor peeta for distracting me from having 
seems to be intentionally avoiding my gaze as he 
no says cato pushing away the bow ill do better 
blade at his belt 
begin to climb again gale always says i remind him 
slenderest limb part of its my weight but part of its 
and feet im another thirty feet in the air when i hear 
a branch go down he hits the ground hard and im 
to his feet swearing like a fiend 
her — ugh the names the people in district 1 give 
scales the tree until the branches begin to crack 
im at least eighty feet high now she tries to shoot me 
with a bow one of the arrows gets lodged in the tree 
teasingly above her head as if this was the sole 
if i ever get the chance i could kill them everyone of 
 
them growling conspiratorially among themselves 
has arrived and their window of attack on me is 
stay up there its not like shes going anywhere well 
well hes right about one thing im going nowhere 
to feel the full potency of my burns i scoot down to a 
my jacket lay out my sleeping bed belt myself in 
too much for my leg i cut a slash in the fabric and 
the wound my hands 
hunger but cant bring myself to eat even if i can last 
the foliage trying to will myself to rest but the burns 
lullabies to their young night creatures emerge an 
the smoke the eyes of some animal peer at me from 
the firelight from the careers torches suddenly im 
their glassy reflection too well in fact those are not 
her out watching me silently from between the 
how long has she been here the whole time 
beneath her perhaps she headed up her tree shortly 
 
even rustling a leaf her little hand slides into the 
 
above me at first i have no idea what shes pointing 
vague shape in the dimming light but of  of what 
raccoon but it hangs from the bottom of a branch 
among the familiar evening sounds of the woods my 
nest 
keep still after all i dont know what kind of wasp 
andwellleaveyoualone type but these are the 
likely they will be one of the capitols muttations 
were spawned in a lab and strategically placed like 
larger than regular wasps they have a distinctive 
of a plum on contact most people cant tolerate more 
hallucinations brought on by the venom have actually 
these wasps will hunt down anyone who disturbs 
tracker part of the name comes from 
surrounding their city but the ones near the districts 
weakness i suppose just like the hunger games 
 
we immediately head in the opposite direction 
for help but shes melted into her tree 
what type of wasp nest it is im wounded and 
by the time the sun rises the careers will have 
could do otherwise after ive made them look so 
i can drop it down on them i may be able to escape 
of course ill never be able to get in close enough to 
branch at the trunk and send the whole thing down 
manage that but can my hands and will the 
if the careers figure out what im doing and move 
i realize that the best chance ill have to do the sawing 
that could begin any time i drag myself out of my 
begin to make my way up the tree this in itself is 
precariously thin even for me but i persevere when i 
becomes more distinctive but its still oddly subdued 
sedated them this was the one defense the rebels 
 
anthem blares out its now or never i think and 
awkwardly drag the knife back and forth once ive 
almost more than i can handle i grit my teeth and 
that there were no deaths today thats all right the 
and the pack below me but the anthems running 
the wood when the music ends the sky goes dark 
now what i could probably finish off the job by sense 
wasps are too groggy if the nest catches on its way 
waste of time better i think to sneak up here at 
in the faint light of the careers torches i inch back 
had sitting on my sleeping bag is a small plastic pot 
sponsor haymitch must have had it sent in during 
hand what can it be not food surely i unscrew the 
cautiously i probe the surface of the ointment the 
oh haymitch i whisper thank you he has not 
the cost of this medicine must be astronomical 
contributed to buy this one tiny pot to me it is 
 
over my calf the effect is almost magical erasing the 
behind this is no herbal concoction that my mother 
medicine brewed up in the capitols labs when my 
wrapping the pot in the parachute i nestle it safely 
i can do to reposition myself in my bag before i plunge 
a bird perched just a few feet from me alerts me that 
examine my hands the medicine has transformed all 
still feels inflamed but that burn was far deeper i 
my gear whatever happens im going to have to 
and a strip of beef and drink a few cups of water 
im already starting to feel the effects of hunger 
on the ground by her position leaning up against 
supposed to be on guard but fatigue overcame her 
to me but i cant make out rue since she tipped me 
to die today its rue i want to win even if it means a 
crowned victor is unbearable 
appear wide and alert at once she points up to the 
nest again i hold up my knife and make a sawing 
in a nearby tree then the same noise again a bit 
all i can do not to laugh out loud is this what she 
the training equipment never touching the floor she 
rosy streaks are breaking through in the east i cant 
last nights climb this one is a cinch at the tree limb 
and im about to draw the teeth across the wood 
bright gold gleam of a tracker j acker lazily making its 
acting a little subdued but the wasp is up and 
well sweat breaks out on the palms of my hands 
pat them dry on my shirt if i dont get through this 
could emerge and attack me 
grip the knife handle and bear down as hard as i can 
buzz and i hear them coming out back forth back 
know one has found me and the others will be honing 
through i shove the end of the branch as far away 
branches snagging temporarily on a few but then 
ground the nest bursts open like an egg and a 
 
and their venom almost immediately makes me 
barbed stingers out of my flesh fortunately only 
the nest went down the rest of the insects have 
its mayhem the careers have woken to a fullscale 
sense to drop everything and bolt i can hear cries of 
evade the wasps by taking to the water it must be 
insects glimmer and another girl the one from 
stings before theyre even out of my view glimmer 
bat the wasps off with her bow which is pointless 
returns the girl from district 4 staggers out of sight 
watch glimmer fall twitch hysterically around on the 
the nest is nothing but an empty shell the wasps 
theyll return but i dont want to risk it i scamper 
opposite direction of the lake the poison from the 
my own little pool and submerge myself in the water 
about five minutes i drag myself onto the rocks 
jacker stings actually the one on my knee is closer 
green liquid oozes from the places where i pulled out 
 
twitching to death on the ground its a lot to handle 
want to think about what glimmer must look like 
stiffening around the bow    
thought connects to another and im on my feet 
bow the arrows i must get them i havent heard the 
of coma her heart still struggling against the wasp 
death a hovercraft will move in and retrieve her body 
out of the games for good and i refuse to let them 
i reach glimmer just as the cannon fires the tracker 
beautiful in her golden dress the night of the 
her limbs three times their normal size the stinger 
liquid around her i have to break several of what 
the sheath of arrows is pinned under her back i try 
flesh disintegrates in my hands and i fall back on the 
is this real or have the hallucinations begun i 
mouth ordering myself not to become sick breakfast 
again a second cannon fires and im guessing the girl 
silent and then one give the warning call which 
means a hovercraft is about to appear confused i 
make sense because im still in the picture still 
and the trees around me begin to spin in circles in 
myself over glimmers body as if to protect it but then 
and vanishing 
my hands under glimmers body get a hold on what 
i cant help it im hyperventilating now the whole 
whats real i tug on the silver sheath of arrows but 
something and finally yank it free ive just encircled 
several pairs coming through the underbrush and i 
back to kill me or get their weapons or both 
sheath and try to position it on the bowstring but 
the stings is so repulsive i cant do it i cant do it i 
im helpless as the first hunter crashes through the 
peetas face makes no sense to me i wait for the blow 
what are you still doing here he hisses at me i 
off a sting under his ear his whole body starts 
mad hes prodding me with the shaft of the spear 
now get up get up i rise but hes still pushing at 
from him hard runfhe screams run 
hes sparkling wet too and badly stung under one 
as peeta says holding tightly to my bow and arrows 
tripping and falling as i try to keep my balance back 
begins to bend in alarming ways a butterfly balloons 
stars trees transform to blood and splash down over 
my hands and i cant shake them free theyre 
screaming a long high pitched scream that never 
i trip and fall into a small pit lined with tiny orange 
tucking my knees up to my chin i wait for death 
thought peeta mellark just saved my life 
 
to find a greater terror awaiting me all the things i 
in such vivid detail i cant help but believe theyre 
but it isnt its only the beginning of a new chapter of 
my fathers last moments feel my own body ripped 
so carefully created to target the place where fear lives 
when i finally do come to my senses i lie still waiting 
accept that the poison must have finally worked its 
feeble im still lying on my side locked in the fetal 
untouched by ants that never existed simply 
so many parts of me hurt it doesnt seem worthwhile 
to sit up im in a shallow hole not filled with the 
with old dead leaves my clothings damp but i dont 
cause for a long time all i can do is take tiny sips 
a honeysuckle bush 
reason now its afternoon but the stiffness in my 
possibly if so 111 have no way of knowing which 
 
boy from district 1 both tributes from district 2 and 
lived their last days must have been as horrid as my 
take much venom to do her in but then again  the 
had a good head start 
has little effect on it i drag myself over to the 
the stamen through the blossom and set the drop of 
my mouth down my throat warming my veins with 
presence beside me for some reason our discussion 
we could do it you know 
leave the district run off live in the woods you 
and suddenly im not thinking of gale but of peeta 
the time we met up i couldnt tell what was real and 
imagine but if he did and my instincts tell me he 
angle he initiated at the interview or was he actually 
doing with those careers in the first place none of it 
i wonder what gale made of the incident for a 
 
coexist well together in my thoughts 
happened since i landed in the arena i have a bow 
retrieved in the tree they bear no trace of the 
— which leads me to believe that might not have been 
blood on them i can clean them later but i do take a 
more like the weapons in the training center than my 
the weapons give me an entirely new perspective on 
face but i am no longer merely prey that runs and 
through the trees right now i wouldnt flee id shoot 
pleasure 
body im very dehydrated again and my water supply 
put on by gorging myself during prep time in the 
hip bones and ribs are more prominent than i 
my fathers death and then there are my wounds to 
smashing into the trees and three tracker jacker 
my burns with the ointment and try dabbing a bit on 
mother knew a treatment for them some type of leaf 
 
let alone its appearance 
its easy to see the direction i came from by the path 
foliage so i walk off in the other direction hoping my 
j acker venom 
motions but i establish the slow hunters tread i use 
rabbit and make my first kill with the bow and arrow 
take it after about an hour i find a stream shallow 
suns hot and severe so while i wait for my water to 
the mild current im filthy from head to toe i try 
water for a few minutes letting it wash off the soot 
burns after rinsing out my clothes and hanging them 
bit untangling my hair with my fingers my appetite 
handful of moss i polish the blood from my silver 
refreshed i treat my burns again braid back my 
will dry them soon enough following the stream 
action im traveling uphill now which i prefer with a 
game i easily take out a strange bird that must be 
edible to me by late afternoon i decide to build a 
small fire to cook the meat betting that dusk will help 
nightfall i clean the game taking extra care with the 
feathers are plucked its no bigger than a chicken 
over the coals when i hear the twig snap 
and arrow to my shoulder theres no one there no 
boot just peeking out from behind the trunk of a tree 
the woods like a shadow you have to give her that 
come out of my mouth before i can stop them 
alliances i say 
edges around the trunk you want me for an ally 
youre smart enough to still be alive and i cant seem 
to decide you hungry i can see her swallow hard 
two kills today 
stings 
she digs in the pack she carries and pulls out a 
my mother uses where d you find those 
just around we all carry them when we work in the 
there are a lot here too 
say orchards huh that must be how you can fly 
ive landed on one of the few things shell admit pride 
i plunk down by the fire and roll up my pant leg to 
places the handful of leaves into her mouth and 
methods but its not like we have a lot of options 
of chewed leaves and spit on my knee 
can stop it its as if the leaves are actually leaching 
rue gives a giggle lucky you had the sense to pull 
do my neck do my cheek i almost beg 
and soon im laughing because the relief is so sweet i 
something for that i set aside my weapons and 
you have good sponsors she says longingly 
head you will though watch the closer we get to 
are i turn the meat over 
you werent joking about wanting me for an ally 
no i meant it i say i can almost hear haymitch 
want her because shes a survivor and i trust her 
okay she says and holds out her hand we 
of course this kind of deal can only be temporary 
rue contributes a big handful of some sort of starchy 
sharp sweet taste of a parsnip she recognizes the 
district she says sometimes a flock will wander into 
a while all conversation stops as we fill our 
fatty the grease drips down your face when you bite 
oh says rue with a sigh ive never had a whole leg 
ill bet she hasnt ill bet meat hardly ever comes her 
really she asks 
arrows i can get more plus ive got snares i can 
uncertainly at the leg oh take it i say putting the 
anyway and weve got the whole bird plus the 
rabbit once shes got hold of it her appetite wins out 
id have thought in district eleven youd have a bit 
food i say 
the crops 
they whip you and make everyone else watch says 
i can tell by her expression that its not that 
thing in district 12 although occasionally one occurs 
basis for poaching in the woods — well technically 
officials buy our meat besides our mayor madges 
events maybe being the least prestigious poorest 
advantages such as being largely ignored by the 
do you get all the coal you want rue asks 
track in on our boots 
people can keep going longer says rue 
not during harvest everyone works then says rue 
its interesting hearing about her life we have so 
in fact i wonder if the gamemakers are blocking out 
information seems harmless they dont want people 
at rues suggestion we lay out all our food to plan 
couple of crackers and beef strips to the pile shes 
even some berries 
is safe 
them for days she says popping a handful in her 
our blackberries taking rue on as an ally seems a 
supplies so in case were separated well both be set 
water skin a homemade slingshot and an extra pair 
as a knife i know its not much she says as if 
cornucopia fast 
she gasps a little when she sees the sunglasses 
in my pack theyve been useless so far they dont 
with a shrug 
these arent for sun theyre for darkness exclaims 
theyll pass out a few pairs to those of us highest in 
time this boy martin he tried to keep his pair hid it 
they killed a boy for taking these i say 
wasnt right in the head i mean he still acted like a 
with says rue 
sort of safe haven of course people keel over from 
peacekeepers murdering a simpleminded child 
who wanders around the hob shes not quite right 
scraps and things 
they let you see in complete darkness says rue 
i give rue some matches and she makes sure i have 
extinguish our fire and head upstream until its 
where do you sleep i ask her in the trees she 
rue holds up her extra pair of socks i have these for 
 
share my sleeping bag if you want well both easily 
dared hope for 
night just as the anthem begins to play there were 
rue i only woke up today how many nights did i 
still i whisper i even take the precaution of covering 
know what im planning to tell her about peeta 
two she says the girls from districts one and 
something strange happened at least i think it did 
me imagine things i say you know the boy from my 
with the careers 
their base camp by the lake they made it back before 
maybe he did save you and had to run 
debt again and this cant be paid back if he did it 
make people think hes in love with me 
an act 
course it is i say he worked it out with our 
lets try out these glasses i pull out the glasses and 
from the leaves on the trees to a skunk strolling 
it from here if i had a mind to i could kill anyone 
the careers have two pairs but theyve got 
so strong 
you are you can shoot she says what can i do 
they dont need to they have all those supplies 
say they didnt say the supplies were gone how 
games right 
no theyre not thats the problem i agree and for 
motivated by the need for flight and evasion an 
rue 
rue has decided to trust me wholeheartedly i know 
snuggles up against me and falls asleep nor do i 
precautions if shed wanted me dead all she would 
pointing out the tracker jacker nest needling me at 
cant win these games but since the odds are still 
thought 
careers and their supplies somehow rue and i must 
feeding themselves will be a tremendous struggle 
hold of all the food early on and work from there the 
a pack of hideous reptiles destroyed it another a 
usually the years that tributes from other districts 
growing up is actually to their disadvantage because 
and i do 
tonight my wounds recovering my mind still a bit 
side her head cradled on my shoulder have given me 
very lonely ive been in the arena how comforting the 
my drowsiness resolving that tomorrow the tables 
will turn tomorrow its the careers who will have to 
the boom of the cannon jolts me awake the skys 
perches in a branch across from me her hands 
but there arent any 
peeta 
others says rue i guess well know tonight 
the boy from district one both tributes from two 
peeta says rue thats eight wait and the boy from 
theres someone else but neither of us can remember 
i wonder how that last one died says rue 
the crowd for a bit maybe well have time to do 
been moving too slowly i say whats in your 
breakfast says rue she holds them out revealing 
what kind are those i ask 
not sure theres a marshy area over that way some 
itd be nice to cook them but neither of us wants to 
a victim of the careers which means theyve 
suck out the insides of an egg eat a rabbit leg and 
ready to do it i say pulling on my pack 
you can tell shes up for whatever i propose 
really how you can see the glint of excitement in 
prim for whom adventures are an ordeal 
hunt i say 
too busy getting every scrap of information i can out 
spy on them briefly but shes observant they have 
is about thirty yards away during the day theyve 
to watch over the supplies 
with them 
too when they drew the tracker j ackers in by the 
lake says rue i guess they agreed to let him live if 
what weapons does he have i ask 
to hold a few of us off with that but thresh could kill 
and the foods just out in the open i say she 
setup 
ruekatniss even if you could get to the food how 
burn it dump it in the lake soak it in fuel i poke 
giggles dont worry 111 think of something 
for a while we dig roots we gather berries and 
come to know rue the oldest of six kids fiercely 
younger ones who forages in the meadows in a 
than ours rue who when you ask her what she loves 
music i say in our world i rank music somewhere 
usefulness at least a rainbow gives you a tip about 
we sing at home at work too thats why i love your 
again forgotten about 
you have mocking ays i ask 
can sing back and forth for hours they carry 
what do you mean i say 
that signals quitting time theres a special little song 
little fournote run in a sweet clear voice and the 
everyone knows to knock off she continues they 
nests but you cant blame them for that 
take it it has more meaning for you than me 
pin i like to see it on you thats how i decided i 
necklace woven out of some kind of grass from her 
maybe its a flower its a good luck charm 
mockingjay back on my shirt maybe you should just 
by lunch we have a plan by early afternoon we are 
wood for the first two campfires the third shell have 
the site where we ate our first meal together the 
leave i make sure rues well stocked with food and 
matches i even insist she take my sleeping bag in 
what about you wont you be cold she asks 
say you know stealing isnt illegal here i say with a 
at the last minute rue decides to teach me her 
days work is done it might not work but if you hear 
i cant get back right away 
havent you seen them theyve got nests 
noticed 
for dinner i say 
hesitate a moment before i hug her back 
you too i say i turn and head back to the stream 
about rue not being killed and the two of us being left 
alone back home no prim has my mother and gale 
rue has only me 
downhill to the place i initially picked it up after the 
tracker jacker attack i have to be cautious as i move 
preoccupied with unanswered questions most of 
morning did that signify his death if so how did he 
for letting me live i struggle again to remember that 
the trees but just the fact that he was sparkling 
i must have been moving very slowly yesterday 
bath in just a few hours i stop to replenish my water 
bent on reverting to orange no matter how many 
my proximity to the careers camp sharpens my 
guarded i am pausing frequently to listen for 
string of my bow i dont see any other tributes but i 
patches of the sweet berries a bush with the leaves 
in the vicinity of the tree i was trapped in and here 
wing in the branches high over my head 
foot i pause a moment to gather my courage rue 
best spying place near the lake from this point 
them i get a firmer grasp on my bow and go on i 
have to admire her cleverness its right at the edge of 
 
spotted between us lies the flat expanse where the 
there are four tributes the boy from district 1 cato 
skinned boy who must be from district 3 he made 
the capitol i can remember almost nothing about 
interview even now as he sits there fiddling with 
presence of his large and domineering companions 
bothered to let him live still seeing him only adds to 
possibly leave him as a guard why they have allowed 
all four tributes seem to still be recovering from the 
large swollen lumps on their bodies they must not 
did not known about the leaves that healed them 
cornucopia have been ineffective 
insides have been picked clean most of the supplies 
piled neatly in a pyramid in what seems a 
sprinkled around the perimeter of the pyramid 
cornucopia at the onset of the games a canopy of 
be useless shelters the pyramid itself 
the whole setup is completely perplexing the 
from district 3 one things for sure destroying those 
other factor is at play here and id better stay put 
is boobytrapped in some manner i think of 
broken sends a poisonous dart into your heart 
while i am mulling over my options i hear cato shout 
and without turning i know that rue must have set 
green wood to make the smoke noticeable the 
an argument breaks out its loud enough for me to 
district 3 should stay or accompany them 
jobs done here anyway no one can touch those 
what about lover boy says the boy from district 1  
cut him its a miracle he hasnt bled to death yet at 
so peeta is out there in the woods wounded badly 
betray the careers 
hands of the boy from district 3 and they head off in 
 
kill her in my own way and no one interferes 
didnt drop a nest of tracker jackers on him 
what to do about the supplies the one advantage i 
a flaming arrow into the pyramid easily enough — im 
in the net — but theres no guarantee it would catch 
have achieved nothing and given them far too much 
an accomplice that i can use the bow and arrow with 
theres no alternative im going to have to get in 
the supplies in fact im just about to reveal myself 
yards to my right i see someone emerge from the 
recognize foxface — shes the one we couldnt 
when she decides its safe she runs for the pyramid 
circle of supplies that have been littered around the 
carefully places her feet on a spot then she begins to 
sometimes landing on one foot teetering slightly 
launches up in the air over a small barrel and lands 
her momentum throws her forward i hear her give a 
nothing happens in a moment shes regained her 
feet and continues until she has reached the bulk of 
so im right about the booby trap but its clearly 
the girl too how wily is she to have discovered this 
neatly she fills her pack taking a few items from a 
of apples from a burlap sack that hangs suspended 
from each not enough to tip off that the food is 
shes doing her odd little dance back out of the circle 
sound 
has confirmed what id already guessed but what 
dexterity has so many trigger points why did she 
youd have thought  and slowly it begins to dawn on 
to explode 
careers willingness to leave their supplies foxfaces 
where they have the factories where they make 
where did he get them in the supplies thats not 
given that they like to see the tributes draw blood 
the round metal plates that lifted the tributes into the 
patted back down the land mines were disabled after 
 
them ive never seen anyone in the games do that i 
well hurray for the boy from district 3 for putting 
now obviously i cant go strolling into that mess 
burning arrow thats more laughable than ever the 
lot either one year a girl dropped her token a small 
literally had to scrape bits of her off the ground 
rocks in there and set off what maybe one mine 
the boy from district 3 have placed the mines in such 
others thereby protecting the supplies but ensuring 
mine id draw the careers back down on me for sure 
clearly strung to deflect any such attack besides 
there at once setting off a big chain reaction 
i glance back up at the woods the smoke from rues 
careers have probably begun to suspect some sort of 
there is a solution to this i know there is if i can 
bins the crates too heavy to topple over with an 
burning arrow idea is reviving when i realize i could 
 
genuinely thinking of trying to recreate foxfaces trip 
destruction when my eyes light on the burlap bag of 
as much in the training center its a big bag but it 
could free the apples themselves  
three arrows to get the job done i place my feet 
meticulous aim the first arrow tears through the side 
the second widens it to a gaping hole i can see the 
catching the torn flap of burlap and ripping it from 
for a moment everything seems frozen in time then 
backward into the air 
the impact with the hardpacked earth of the plain 
soften the blow fortunately my quiver has caught in 
shoulder and my bow is locked in my grasp the 
i cant hear anything at the moment but the apples 
activate the others i manage to shield my face with 
burning rain down around me an acrid smoke fills 
trying to regain the ability to breathe 
roll on my side and allow myself a moment of 
was recently the pyramid the careers arent likely to 
id better get out of here i think they 11 be making a 
escape may not be so simple im dizzy not the 
trees swooping around you and causes the earth to 
i take a few steps and somehow wind up on my hands 
doesnt 
essential but i can neither walk nor hear i place a 
the blast and it comes away bloody have i gone deaf 
from the explosion the idea frightens me i rely as 
more at times but i cant let my fear show 
panem 
hood up over my head tie the cord under my chin 
the blood i cant walk but can i crawl i move 
crawl most of the woods will offer insufficient cover 
conceal myself in greenery i cant get caught out here 
face death its sure to be a long and painful one at 
that keeps me doggedly inching my way toward the 
another blast knocks me flat on my face a stray 
twice more im reminded of those last few kernels 
home 
understatement i have literally just dragged myself 
when theres cato barreling onto the plain soon 
might be comical — so people really do tear out their 
know that it was aimed at me at what i have done to 
defend myself and in fact the whole thing has me 
for the cameras to get a close shot of me because im 
 
from chattering 
and must have declared all the mines activated 
cato has finished the first phase of his tantrum and 
kicking open various containers the other tributes 
to salvage but theres nothing the boy from district 
cato too because he turns on the boy and appears 
has time to turn and run before cato catches him in a 
catos arms as he sharply jerks the boys head to the 
its that quick the death of the boy from district 3 
down i can tell he wants to return to the woods but 
i realize of course they think whoever set off the 
they dont know about the arrows and the apples 
tribute who blew up the supplies was killed doing it if 
lost in the subsequent explosions the shattered 
retire to the far side of the lake to allow the 
district 3 and they wait 
i suppose a cannon goes off a hovercraft appears and 
night falls up in the sky i see the seal and know the 
they show the boy from district 3 they show the boy 
then the seal reappears so now they know the 
and the girl from district 2 put on their nightvision 
for a torch illuminating the grim determination on all 
hunt 
still deafened i can hear a ringing in my right which 
hiding place though im about as safe as i can be 
bomber has a two or threehour lead on them still 
the first thing i do is dig out my own glasses and put 
one of my hunters senses working i drink some 
smell of meat will draw unwanted predators — fresh 
greens and roots and berries rue and i gathered 
where is my little ally did she make it back to the 
the sky has shown were both alive 
the boy from 1 both from 2 foxface both from 1 1 
really hot in the capitol theyll be doing special 
features on each of us now probably interviewing our 
tribute from district 12 made it into the top eight 
cato said peetas on his way out not that cato is the 
stash of supplies 
think let them begin for real 
bag before i remember i left it with rue i was 
mines and all i forgot i begin to shiver since 
scoop out a hollow under the bushes and cover 
i lay my sheet of plastic over my upper body and 
better i begin to have more sympathy for the girl from 
me who needs to grit my teeth and tough it out until 
arms inside my jacket and tuck my knees up to my 
when i open my eyes the world looks slightly 
sun must be well up and the glasses fragmenting my 
somewhere near the lake and freeze the laughs 
must be regaining my hearing yes my right ear can 
ear well at least the bleeding has stopped 
returned trapping me here for an indefinite time no 
its foxface standing in the rubble of the pyramid 
actually finding a few useful items in the ashes a 
amusement until i realize that with the careers 
just like the rest of us it crosses my mind to reveal 
pack but i rule it out theres something about that 
would ultimately get me a knife in the back with that 
but shes heard something not me because her head 
the woods i wait no one nothing shows up still if 
me to get out of here too besides im eager to tell 
since ive no idea where the careers are the route 
loaded bow in one hand a hunk of cold groosling in 
leaves and berries but for the fat and protein in the 
there i refill my water and wash taking particular 
the stream as a guide at one point i find boot prints 
here but not for a while the prints are deep because 
dry in the hot sun i havent been careful enough 
the pine needles to conceal my prints now i strip off 
stream 
my spirits i shoot two fish easy pickings in this slow 
moving stream and go ahead and eat one raw even 
for rue 
diminishes until its gone entirely i find myself 
away whatever deadens its ability to collect sounds if 
to deafness in the ear it makes me feel offbalanced 
turning to the injured side as my right ear tries to 
yesterday there was a constant flow of information 
this is an injury that will heal 
certain its been undisturbed theres no sign of rue 
she should have returned as its midday 
somewhere what else could she do with no light and 
around the woods and the third fire she was 
last night — was the farthest from our site of all 
way back i wish shed hurry because i dont want to 
afternoon traveling to higher ground hunting as we 
i wash the blood out of my jacket and hair and clean 
better but i use a bit of medicine on them anyway 
infection i go ahead and eat the second fish it isnt 
 
just show up 
lopsided hearing i scale a tree to wait if the careers 
the sun moves slowly i do things to pass the time 
deflated but still tender comb through my damp hair 
check over my bow and remaining nine arrows test 
near it but without good results 
growling and i know im going to have what we call a 
matter what you put in your belly its never enough 
so i decide to give into it after all ive lost a lot of 
having the bow and arrows makes me far more 
i slowly peel and eat a handful of nuts my last 
takes time to pick clean finally a groosling wing and 
with all that i start daydreaming about food 
the chicken in creamy orange sauce the cakes and 
the lamb and dried plum stew i suck on a few mint 
because we drink mint tea after supper often so it 
sort of 
dangling up in the tree with the sun warming me a 
is the most relaxed ive been since ive entered the 
out as the shadows grow so does my restlessness 
can at least visit the spot where she set the third fire 
before i go i scatter a few mint leaves around our old 
away rue will understand ive been here while theyll 
in less than an hour im at the place where we agreed 
amiss the wood has been neatly arranged expertly 
rue set up the fire but never made it back here 
spied before i blew up the supplies and this point she 
i have to remind myself shes still alive or is she 
come in the wee hours of the morning when even my 
appear in the sky tonight no i refuse to believe it 
could have lost her way run into a pack of predators 
whatever happened im almost certain shes stuck 
unlit one at my feet something is keeping her up a 
i think ill go hunt it down 
its a relief to be doing something after sitting around 
letting them conceal me but nothing seems 
disruption of the needles on the ground ive stopped 
head around to the side to be sure but there it is 
mockingj ays mouth the one that means shes all 
i grin and move in the direction of the bird another 
of notes rue has been singing to them and recently 
eyes lift up into the trees searching for a sign of her i 
safe to join me a mockingj ay repeats the melody to 
its a childs scream a young girls scream theres no 
rue and now im running knowing this may be a 
attack me but i cant help myself theres another 
katniss 
know im near and hopefully the girl who has 
eleven they still cant explain will be enough to pull 
when i break into the clearing shes on the ground 
reach her hand through the mesh and say my name 
 
spear my arrow drives deeply into the center of his 
remainder of his life by yanking out the arrow and 
aim from side to side while i shout at rue are there 
she has to say no several times before i hear it rue 
the spear i shove the boy away from her and pull out 
wound and i know its far beyond my capacity to heal 
up to the shaft in her stomach i crouch before her 
no point in comforting words in telling her shell be 
clutch it like a lifeline as if its me whos dying 
you blew up the food she whispers 
you have to win she says 
promise i hear a cannon and look up it must be for 
dont go rue tightens her grip on my hand 
course not staying right here i say i move in 
brush the dark thick hair back behind her ear 
sing i think sing whati do know a few songs 
too music i helped make my father pulled me in with 
since he died except when prim is very sick then i 
sing my throat is tight with tears hoarse from smoke 
request i have to at least try the song that comes to 
babies to sleep with its old very old i think made up 
mountain air but the words are easy and soothing 
awful piece of time we call today 
deep in the meadow under the willow 
lay down your head and close your sleepy eyes 
here its safe here its warm 
here your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings 
 
rues eyes have fluttered shut her chest moves but 
slide down my cheeks but i have to finish the song 
deep in the meadow hidden far away 
forget your woes and let your troubles lay 
here its safe here its warm 
the final lines are barely audible 
them true 
everythings still and quiet then almost eerily the 
for a moment i sit there watching my tears drip 
and press my lips against her temple slowly as if not 
release her hand 
the bodies and theres nothing to stay for i roll the 
retrieve the arrow that ended his life i cut rues pack 
from her back as well knowing shed want me to have 
bodies will be transported to the hovercraft ive no 
the better 
animal curled up in a nest of netting i cant bring 
utterly defenseless to hate the boy from district 1 
inadequate its the capitol i hate for doing this to all 
gales voice is in my head his ravings against the 
rues death has forced me to confront my own fury 
but here even more strongly than at home i feel my 
capitol is there 
keep wishing i could think of a way to  to show the 
piece in their games and for the first time i 
i want to do something right here right now to 
capitol that whatever they do or force us to do there 
more than a piece in their games and so am i 
wildflowers perhaps they are really weeds of some 
violet and yellow and white i gather up an armful 
 
ugly wound wreathing her face weaving her hair 
theyll have to show it or even if they choose to turn 
bring them back when they collect the bodies and 
back and take a last look at rue she could really be 
bye rue i whisper i press the three middle fingers 
her direction then i walk away without looking back 
the warning whistle that precedes the hovercraft i 
humans cant i pause my eyes focused on whats 
take long then the general birdsong begins again and 
another mockingjay a young one by the look of it 
melody 
novice to pick up but it has mastered her handful of 
good and safe i say as i pass under its branch we 
ive no idea where to go the brief sense of home i had 
this way and that until sunset im not afraid not 
except id kill anyone i met on sight without emotion 
or the slightest tremor in my hands my hatred of the 
in the least especially the careers they at least 
no one materializes though there arent many of us 
some other device to force us together but theres 
sleep 
when a silver parachute floats down and lands in 
been in fairly good shape with supplies maybe 
cheer me up a bit or could it be something to help 
i open the parachute and find a small loaf of bread 
ration grain and shaped in a crescent sprinkled with 
district breads in the training center this bread 
loaf what must it have cost the people of district 1 1 
had to do without to scrape up a coin to put in the 
rue surely but instead of pulling the gift when she 
thankyou or because like me they dont like to let 
a district gift to a tribute whos not your own 
sunlight my thanks to the people of district eleven 
 
recognized 
to get as far away from today as i can my sleeping 
through the supplies tomorrow ill make a new plan 
tiny bites of the bread its good it tastes of home 
right ear i see the boy from district 1 rue thats all 
bread still locked in my hands i fall asleep at once 
brain will give me a happy dream a visit with my 
with prim tonight it sends me rue still decked in 
teach me to talk to the mockingjays i see no sign of 
sings songs ive never heard in a clear melodic voice 
between period when i can hear the last few strains of 
fully awaken im momentarily comforted i try to hold 
slips away leaving me sadder and lonelier than ever 
lead in my veins ive lost the will to do the simplest 
unblinkingly through the canopy of leaves for 
thought of prims anxious face as she watches me on 
lethargy 
i give myself a series of simple commands to follow 
to drink water katniss i act on the orders with slow 
katniss 
water skin a handful of nuts and roots a bit of 
from district 1 has several knives two spare 
firstaid kit a full bottle of water and a pack of dried 
chosen from to me this is a sign of extreme 
such a bounty back at camp when you will kill your 
hungry i can only hope the other careers traveled so 
with nothing 
finish off the loaf from district 1 1 and the last of the 
are rues roots and nuts the boys dried fruit and 
myself 
pack after i climb down the tree i conceal the boys 
one else can use them ive lost my bearings what 
evening but i try and head back in the general 
come across rues third unlit fire shortly thereafter 
and take out three before they know what hit them i 
 
think as i roast the birds and rues roots im waiting 
who knows where the careers are now either too far 
possible too scared of me they know i have the 
from glimmers body but have they put two and two 
killed their fellow career possibly they think thresh 
death than i would being from the same district not 
and what about foxface did she hang around to 
her laughing in the ashes the next morning it was as 
i doubt they think peeta has lit this signal fire catos 
could tell peeta about the flowers i put on rue that i 
roof perhaps if he wins the games hell see me on 
games on a screen over the stage where we did our 
platform surrounded by their support crew 
somehow that seems even more important than the 
i really think i stand a chance of doing it now 
outsmarting the careers a few times although those 
rues hand watching the life drain out of her now i 
am determined to revenge her to make her loss 
thereby making myself unforgettable 
shoot but no one does maybe the other tributes are 
be fine ever since the bloodbath ive been featured 
eventually i wrap up my food and go back to the 
the heaviness from the morning drapes back over me 
and settle in for the night my brain begins to replay 
my arrow piercing the boys neck i dont know why i 
then i realize  he was my first kill 
place their bets every tribute has a list of kills i 
girl from district 4 too for dumping that nest on 
i knew would die because of my actions numerous 
one human i hear gale saying how different can it 
amazingly similar in the execution a bow pulled an 
a boy whose name i dont even know somewhere his 
blood maybe he had a girlfriend who really believed 
 
banish the boy from my mind at least for now 
deaths i wonder how long well get until the next 
tonight i want to get some sleep first i cover my good 
hear the trumpets and sit straight up in anticipation 
tributes get from outside the arena is the nightly 
followed by an announcement usually this will be a 
will invite the players to a banquet somewhere 
to gather and fight sometimes there is a feast and 
the tributes to compete for i wouldnt go in for the 
competitors 
overhead congratulating the six of us who remain 
something very confusing theres been a rule change 
bending since we dont really have any rules to speak 
and the unspoken rule about not eating one another 
district will be declared winners if they are the last 
getting it and repeats the change again 
theyre from the same district both can live both of 
 
 
the victor 
i clap my hands over my mouth but the sound has 
chorus of frogs begin to sing stupid i tell 
the woods to come alive with assailants then i 
peeta whos been wounded is now my ally whatever 
of us took the others life now wed be pariahs when 
watching id loathe any tribute who didnt 
just makes sense to protect each other and in my 
district 12 — its an absolute requirement if i want 
the starcrossed lovers    peeta must have been 
gamemakers have made this unprecedented change 
winning our romance must be so popular with the 
success of the games no thanks to me all ive done 
in the arena he must have the audience convinced it 
from running to the cornucopia fighting cato to let 
have been a move to protect me peeta it turns out 
 
hold my face up to the moonlight so the cameras can 
so who is there left to be afraid of foxface the boy 
alone at night and her strategy has been to evade 
my voice shed do anything but hope someone else 
then theres thresh all right hes a distinct threat 
began i think about how foxface grew alarmed when 
she didnt turn to the woods she turned to whatever 
drops off into i dont know what i feel almost certain 
his domain hed never have heard me from there 
size to reach 
are now surely celebrating the new rule theyre the 
myself do i run from them now on the chance they 
come let them come with their nightvision glasses 
right into the range of my arrows but i know they 
wont risk what could be another trap at night when 
ive let them know my whereabouts 
stay put and get some sleep katnissi instruct 
now tomorrow youll find him 
thinking that while the careers might hesitate to 
setting an ambush for me i make sure to fully 
securing my pack readying my weapons — before i 
the ground 
careers will know im trying to locate peeta they may 
as badly wounded as cato thinks id be in the 
assistance but if hes that incapacitated how has he 
him 
give me an indication as to where hes hiding out but 
saw him sparkling in the sunlight yelling at me to 
i was gone he wounded peeta but how did peeta get 
j acker poison than cato 
escape but hed been stung too so how far could he 
has he stayed alive all these days since if the wound 
would have taken him by now 
and thats when i get my first clue to his 
water i know that from my first few days here he 
lake but i find that an unlikely option since its so 
pools but youd really be a sitting duck at one of 
camp rue and i made all the way down near the lake 
change his location and always be near water he 
might even be able to get a fish or two 
to confuse my enemies minds i start a fire with 
hope theyll decide im hidden somewhere near it 
the sun burns off the morning haze almost 
usual the waters cool and pleasant on my bare feet 
name as i go but decide against it i will have to find 
find me but hell know 111 be looking right he wont 
the new rule and keep to myself would he hes very 
different circumstances but at the moment only 
it doesnt take long to reach the spot where i peeled 
peeta but this doesnt surprise me ive been up and 
incident if he were nearby surely id have had some 
suspicion of it the stream begins to curve to the left 
banks covered in tangled water plants lead to large 
somewhat trapped it would be no small matter to 
i climbed over this rocky terrain in fact ive just 
wounded boy would be unable to navigate getting to 
streak going down the curve of a boulder its long 
suggest someone — who perhaps was not fully in 
hugging the rocks i move slowly in the direction of 
bloodstains one with a few threads of fabric glued to 
in a hushed voice peeta peeta then a mockingjay 
so i stop i give up and climb back down to the stream 
down 
i hear a voice 
i whip around its come from the left so i cant pick 
still it must have been peeta who else in the arena 
but theres nothing just mud the plants the base of 
peeta i whisper where are you theres no 
 
creep along the bank 
i jump back his voice was right under my feet still 
blue in the brown mud and green leaves i gasp and 
its the final word in camouflage forget chucking 
private session with the gamemakers and painted 
full of weeds 
mouth too and completely disappears most of what 
and plants his face and arms are so artfully 
guess all those hours decorating cakes paid off 
dying 
his voice is so ragged says me were on the same 
his eyes open so i heard nice of you to find whats 
i pull out my water bottle and give him a drink did 
left leg up high he answers 
lets get you in the stream wash you off so i can see 
lean down a minute first he says need to tell you 
lips which tickle as he whispers remember were 
feel like it 
keep it in mind at least hes still able to joke 
all the levity disappears its only two feet away how 
to move an inch on his own hes so weak that the 
despite the fact that i know hes doing all he can to 
and plants seem to have imprisoned him and i finally 
clutches hes still two feet from the water lying 
his face 
very shallow here okay i say 
i crouch down beside him no matter what happens i 
three i say one two three i can only manage one 
sound hes making now hes on the edge of the 
okay change of plans im not going to put you all 
knows if id ever be able to get him out 
no more rolling he asks 
on the woods for me okay i say its hard to know 
leaves i cant even see his clothes if hes wearing 
but then i plunge in naked bodies are no big deal in 
ive got two water bottles and rues water skin i prop 
always filling while i pour the third over peetas body 
find his clothes i gently unzip his jacket unbutton 
plastered into his wounds i have to cut it away with 
badly bruised with a long burn across his chest and 
his ear but i feel a bit better this much i can fix i 
some pain before i tackle whatever damage cato did 
since treating his wounds seems pointless when hes 
prop him up against a boulder he sits there 
dirt from his hair and skin his flesh is very pale in 
stocky i have to dig the stingers out of his tracker 
minute i apply the leaves he sighs in relief while he 
spread them over boulders then i apply the burn 
skin is becoming the layer of mud and the bottles of 
 
from district 1 and find pills that reduce your 
buys these on occasion when her home remedies fail 
the medicine you must be hungry 
days says peeta in fact when i offer him groosling 
when i know how sick he is 
itll just come right back up he says the best i can 
thanks im much better really can i sleep now 
soon i promise i need to look at your leg 
boots his socks and then very slowly inch his pants 
fabric over his thigh but it in no way prepares me for 
both blood and pus the swelling of the leg and worst 
i want to run away disappear into the woods like i 
house go and hunt while my mother and prim 
to face but theres no one here but me i try to 
when handling particularly bad cases 
closely 
soso i shrug like its no big deal you should see 
mines i refrain from saying how i usually clear out 
than a cold come to think of it i dont even much 
well 
bad shape and i dont want to pull them over the 
being naked makes me uncomfortable thats another 
effect on them gives them no cause for 
games my little sister would be of far more use to 
him so i can wash down the rest of him with each 
the rest of his lower body has fared pretty well just 
treat quickly but the gash on his leg  what on earth 
why dont we give it some air and then  i trail off 
almost sorry for me as if he knows how lost i am 
these i put a few dried pear halves in his hand and 
when theyre flattened out and drying i examine the 
bandages fever pills medicine to calm stomachs 
were going to have to experiment some i admit i 
 
handful of chewedup green stuff into the wound pus 
this is a good thing and bite the inside of my cheek 
reappearance 
face must be some shade of green he mouths the 
i burst out laughing because the whole thing is so 
something wrong he asks a little too innocently 
idea what im doing and i hate pus i say euh i 
round of leaves and apply the second euuuh 
trust me killing things is much easier than this i 
can you speed it up a little he asks 
after three applications and what seems like a bucket 
swelling has gone down i can see how deep catos 
what next dr everdeen he asks 
think it helps with infection anyway and wrap it up 
i say i do and the whole thing seems a lot more 
against the sterile bandage the hem of his 
pull out rues backpack here cover yourself with 
oh i dont care if you see me says peeta 
all right i turn my back and look at the stream until 
feeling a bit better if he can throw 
person says peeta as i beat the shorts clean between 
after all 
so far 
hits him why did you get something 
some bread 
please he cant stand being in the same room with 
because youre just alike mutters peeta i ignore it 
insulting haymitch which is my first impulse 
i let peeta doze off while his clothes dry out but by 
shake his shoulder peeta weve got to go now 
away from here downstream maybe somewhere we 
dress leaving his feet bare so we can walk in the 
the moment he puts weight on his leg come on you 
but he cant not for long anyway we make it about 
shoulder and i can tell hes going to black out i sit 
and pat his back awkwardly as i survey the area of 
going to happen it could be worse though some of 
sights on one about twenty yards above the stream 
him up to the cave really id like to look around for 
my ally is shot paper white panting and even 
i cover the floor of the cave with a layer of pine 
i get a couple of pills and some water into him when 
then he just lies there his eyes trained on my face as 
mouth of the cave the result is unsatisfactory an 
hands had manufactured it quickly enough i tear it 
 
hair back from his eyes thanks for finding me 
foreheads burning up like the medicines having no 
going to die 
dont talk like that i didnt drain all that pus for 
i know but just in case i dont —  he tries to 
no peeta i dont even want to discuss it i say 
but i —  he insists 
words this is probably overdue anyway since hes 
first time ive ever kissed a boy which should make 
is how unnaturally hot his lips are from the fever i 
around him youre not going to die i forbid it all 
all right he whispers 
floats down from the sky my fingers quickly undo the 
instead i find a pot of hot broth 
haymitch couldnt be sending me a clearer message 
his snarl youre supposed to be in love sweetheart 
and hes right if i want to keep peeta alive ive got to 
crossed lovers desperate to get home together two 
never having been in love this is going to be a real 
failed to bring her gifts from the woods the way my 
at the door the way she almost stopped living when 
peeta i say trying for the special tone that my 
again but i kiss him awake which seems to startle 
gazing at me forever hes great at this stuff 
sent you 
19 
begging threatening and yes kissing but finally sip 
then and attend to my own needs wolfing down a 
report in the sky no new casualties still peeta and i 
hopefully the gamemakers will allow us a peaceful 
i automatically look around for a good tree to nest in 
very well leave peeta unguarded on the ground i left 
stream untouched — how could i conceal it — and 
glasses place my weapons in readiness and settle 
the temperature drops rapidly and soon im chilled to 
sleeping bag with peeta its toasty warm and i 
warm its overly hot because the bag is reflecting 
burning and dry i dont know what to do leave him 
fever take him out and hope the night air cools him 
placing it on his forehead it seems weak but im 
i spend the night half sitting halflying next to peeta 
fact that by teaming up with him ive made myself far 
more vulnerable than when i was alone tethered to 
care of but i knew he was injured and still i came 
whatever instinct sent me to find him was a good one 
on peetas lip and discover the fever has broken hes 
last night when i was gathering vines i came upon a 
up in the broth pot with cold water 
woke up and you were gone he says i was worried 
i have to laugh as i ease him back down you were 
lately 
they like to hunt at night he says still serious 
the girl from district two shes still alive righthe 
yes theres just them and us and thresh and 
five how do you feel 
improvement over the mud he says clean clothes 
oh right the whole romance thing i reach out to 
 
very thing to my mother and i wonder where peeta 
no more kisses for you until youve eaten i say 
obediently swallows the spoonfuls of the berry mush i 
you didnt sleep peeta says 
sleep now ill keep watch ill wake you if anything 
up forever 
and probably better to do it now when he seems 
right i say but just for a few hours then you wake 
its too warm for the sleeping bag now i smooth it out 
loaded bow in case i have to shoot at a moments 
his bad leg stretched out before him his eyes trained 
hand brushes the loose strands of my hair off my 
far this gesture seems natural and comforting i dont 
my hair when i fall asleep 
open my eyes that were into the afternoon peetas 
 
been in days 
of hours i say 
besides i like watching you sleep you dont scowl 
this of course brings on a scowl that makes him 
his cheek hot as a coal stove he claims hes been 
him more fever pills and stand over him while he 
tend to his minor wounds the burns the stings 
unwrap the leg 
worse theres no more pus in evidence but the 
inflamed then i see the red streaks starting to crawl 
him for sure my chewedup leaves and ointment 
infection drugs from the capitol i cant imagine the 
every donation from every sponsor would he have 
games continue what buys a full meal on day one 
medicine peeta needs would have been at a premium 
well theres more swelling but the pus is gone i 
 
peetaeven if my mother isnt a healer 
theyll cure it back at the capitol when we win i say 
mostly for my benefit 
make you soup i say 
well see i say as i take the pot down to the 
the gamemakers are progressively ratcheting up the 
plummeting at night the heat of the sunbaked 
i wont need to light a fire 
stream and the cave after purifying half a pot of 
egg size hot stones to the water im the first to admit 
involves tossing everything in a pot and waiting its 
practically mush and mash some of rues roots 
mostly need to be heated up already between the 
meat and roots swap in fresh rocks and go find 
discover a tuft of chives growing at the base of some 
the pot switch out the rocks again put on the lid 
 
feel comfortable leaving peeta alone while i hunt so i 
about the other tributes how theyre managing now 
least three of them cato clove and foxface had 
got a feeling he must share some of rues knowledge 
fighting each other looking for us maybe one of 
moment to attack the idea sends me back to the 
peetas stretched out on top of the sleeping bag in the 
i come in its clear he feels miserable i put cool 
as they touch his skin 
no he says thank you wait yes tell me a story 
storytelling its kind of like singing but once in a 
something happy tell me about the happiest day 
something between a sigh and a huff of exasperation 
lot more effort than the soup i rack my brains for 
hunting and somehow i dont think these will play 
prim 
did i ever tell you about how i got prims goat i 
expectantly so i begin but carefully because my 
have no doubt put two and two together that i hunt 
the butcher or even the peacekeepers back home who 
breaking the law too 
goat lady it was a friday evening the day before 
ended gale and i hit the woods because i wanted to 
some new cloth for a dress or a hairbrush our 
flush with greens but this was really no more than 
we headed back even though gale said wed be sure 
a stream when we saw him a young buck probably a 
still small and coated in velvet poised to run but 
less beautiful perhaps when the two arrows caught 
i had shot at the same time the buck tried to run 
he knew what had happened momentarily id felt a 
then my stomach rumbled at the thought of all that 
a deer gale and i have only brought down three in 
somehow almost didnt count but we knew from that 
 
parts and actually trying to hack off pieces 
with our deer to the butcher but not before itd been 
with holes although everybody paid up fairly it had 
this time we waited until dark fell and slipped under 
we were known hunters it wouldnt have been good 
of district 12 in daylight like we were rubbing it in the 
the butcher a short chunky woman named rooba 
haggle with rooba she gives you one price which 
offer on the deer and she threw in a couple of venison 
with the money divided in two neither gale nor i had 
keep it a secret and surprise our families with the 
this is where i really got the money for the goat but i 
that cant hurt anyone then i pick up the story in 
gale and i went to the market on the square so that i 
fingers over a length of thick blue cotton cloth 
keeps a small herd of goats on the other side of the 
him the goat man his joints are swollen and twisted 
 
somewhere along the way he saved up enough for 
age besides slowly starve to death hes filthy and 
rich if you can afford it 
lying down in a cart it was easy to see why 
and infection had set in it was bad the goat man 
someone who could fix it 
owning a nanny goat can change your life in district 
meadows a perfect feeding place and they can give 
cheese to sell its not even against the law 
closer look 
stood over the goat as if idly curious 
just looking said gale 
anyone will buy her milk and then they only pay half 
whats the butcher giving for her i asked 
the man shrugged hang around and see i turned 
lucky thing you showed up said the goat man 
not if shes spoken for i said carelessly 
goat shes not look at that shoulder bet you half 
what said the goat man we had a deal 
not that thing sell her to the girl if shes stupid 
i caught her wink 
off his hands it took us half an hour to agree on the 
out opinions it was an excellent deal if the goat lived 
argument but i took the goat 
look on prims face as much as i did in a moment of 
around her neck then we hurried back to my house 
walked in with that goat remember this is a girl who 
so excited she started crying and laughing all at once 
pair of them went to work on it grinding up herbs 
 
forgotten he was there 
have died if it tried i say but then i bite my tongue 
dying in my incompetent hands 
story 
insisted on sleeping with lady on a blanket next to 
licked her cheek like it was giving her a good night 
her 
i think so i say why 
i can see why that day made you happy 
say 
joy you gave the sister you love so much you took her 
the goat has paid for itself several times over i say 
well it wouldnt dare do anything else after you 
thing 
really what did you cost me again i ask 
says 
the levers going nowhere but up youre a little 
the sound of the trumpets startles me im on my feet 
to miss a syllable its my new best friend claudius 
feast well were not that hungry and i actually wave 
on some of you may already be declining my 
needs something desperately 
peetas leg 
marked with your district number at the cornucopia 
some of you this will be your last chance says 
theres nothing else just his words hanging in the 
no he says youre not risking your life for me 
so youre not going he asks 
you think im running straight into some freeforall 
 
out well see whos in the sky tomorrow night and 
youre such a bad liar katniss i dont know how 
knew that goat would be a little gold mine youre a 
shakes his head never gamble at cards youll lose 
anger flushes my face all right i am going and you 
i can follow you at least partway i may not make it 
someone can find me and then ill be dead for sure 
you wont get a hundred yards from here on that 
then 111 drag myself says peeta you go and im 
hes just stubborn enough and maybe just strong 
even if a tribute doesnt find him something else 
wall him up in the cave just to go myself and who 
what am i supposed to do sit here and watch you 
the audience would hate me and frankly i would 
i wont die i promise if you promise not to go he 
 
argue him out of this one so i dont try i pretend 
say drink your water wake me when i tell you and 
is i snap at him 
wait here i say the airs gone cold even though the 
messing with the temperature i wonder if the thing 
soup is still nice and warm in its iron pot and 
peeta eats without complaint even scraping out the 
how delicious it is which should be encouraging if 
listening to haymitch before the alcohol has soaked 
medicine before he goes off his head completely 
is that hes going to die if i dont get to that feast ill 
infection will reach his heart or his brain or his lungs 
waiting for the others 
parachute even though it floats right by me then i 
the silver fabric to retrieve the vial haymitch has 
persuaded some gaggle of romantic fools to sell their 
though it must be very strong to cure someone as ill 
as peeta a ripple of doubt runs through me i uncork 
sickly sweet scent just to be sure i place a drop on 
syrup its a common medicine in district 12 cheap 
everyones had a dose at one time or another we 
hysterical patients to knock them out to stitch up a 
someone in pain get through the night it only takes a 
day but what good is that im so furious im about 
when it hits me a full day thats more than i need 
as noticeable and add some mint leaves for good 
brought you a treat i found a new patch of berries a 
peeta opens his mouth for the first bite without 
very sweet 
from them havent you ever had them before i say 
no he says almost puzzled but they taste 
well you cant get them in the market much they 
just one more to go 
spoonful syrup his eyes widen as he realizes the 
truth i clamp my hand over his mouth and nose 
to make himself vomit the stuff up but its too late 
away i can see in his eyes what ive done is 
i sit back on my heels and look at him with a mixture 
chin and i wipe it away who cant lie peeta i say 
it doesnt matter the rest of panem can 
in the remaining hours before nightfall i gather rocks 
its a slow and arduous process but after a lot of 
pleased with my work the cave now appears to be 
vicinity i can still crawl in to peeta through a small 
thats good because ill need to share that sleeping 
the feast peeta will be hidden but not entirely 
longer without medicine if i die at the feast district 
i make a meal out of the smaller bonier fish that 
container and purify it and clean my weapons ive 
peeta so hell have some protection while im gone 
camouflage being his final defense but i still might 
encounter 
least cato clove and thresh will be on hand when 
direct confrontation isnt her style or her forte shes 
picked up some weapons recently shell probably be 
scavenge but the other three  im going to have my 
greatest asset but i know 111 have to go right into the 
thick of things to get that backpack the one with the 
mentioned 
dawn but nobody appears tonight tomorrow there 
fatalities 
next to peeta luckily i had that good long sleep 
anyone will attack our cave tonight but i cant risk 
so cold so bitterly cold tonight as if the 
across the arena which may be exactly what theyve 
every bit of his fever heat its strange to be so 
might as well be back in the capitol or in district 12 
ive never felt lonelier since the games began 
to but i cant help thinking of my mother and prim 
stage in the games with an important event like the 
either watch on that staticfilled old clunker of a 
watch on the big clear screens theyll have privacy 
them a kind word a bit of food if they can spare it i 
now that peeta and i are a team and made good on 
 
rarely have anyone to root for at this point in the 
me especially now that were together if i close my 
us on i see their faces — greasy sac and madge and 
us 
cheering but hell be watching every moment every 
wonder if hes hoping that peeta makes it as well 
that door he talked about us running away together 
survival away from the district or something more 
through a crack in the rocks i watch the moon cross 
before dawn i begin final preparations im careful to 
beside him nothing else will be of much use if i dont 
short time after some debate i strip him of his jacket 
now in the sleeping bag with his fever and during the 
it my hands are already stiff from cold so i take 
thumbs and pull them on it helps anyway i fill her 
bandages tuck the knife in my belt get my bow and 
importance of sustaining the starcrossed lover 
lingering kiss i imagine the teary sighs emanating 
from the capitol and pretend to brush away a tear of 
rocks out into the night 
its as cold as a november night at home one where 
gale at some prearranged place where well sit 
wrapped in quilting hoping game will pass our way 
you had my back now    
remarkable but i still sorely miss having the use of 
damaged something deep and irreparable never 
to pay someone to do my hearing 
the glasses everything has an unfamiliar slant to it 
gone to bed and sent slightly more ominous versions 
tricky like taking a new route i make my way back 
hiding place near the lake along the way i see no 
quiver of a branch either im the first to arrive or the 
more than an hour maybe two when i wriggle into 
flow 
much more thank goodness i have peetas jacket as 
stay warm the sky turns a misty morning gray and 
still theres no sign of the other tributes its not 
themselves either by strength or deadliness or 
with me i doubt foxface and thresh even know he 
me when i go in for the backpack 
me to remove my glasses i can hear the morning 
panicked that im at the wrong location but no im 
the cornucopia and there it is and here i am so 
just as the first ray of sun glints off the gold 
ground before the mouth of the horn splits in two and 
arena on the table sit four backpacks two large 
green one with the number 5 and a tiny orange one 
be marked with a 12 
darts out of the cornucopia snags the green 
come up with such a clever and risky idea the rest of 
situation and shes got hers shes got us trapped 
while their own pack sits so vulnerable on the table 
alone knowing that to steal one without her number 
been my strategy by the lime ive worked through the 
 
disappear into the trees well out of shooting range 
foxface is the real opponent here 
i must get to the table next anyone who beats me to 
hesitation i sprint for the table i can sense the 
first knife comes whizzing in on my right side so i can 
drawing back the bowstring and send an arrow 
avoid a fatal hit but the point punctures her upper 
but its enough to slow her down a few moments 
severity of the wound i keep moving positioning the 
hunted for years can do 
orange backpack my hand slips between the straps 
on any other part of my anatomy and im turning to 
forehead it slices above my right eyebrow opening a 
blinding my eye filling my mouth with the sharp 
but still manage to send my readied arrow in the 
my hands it will miss and then clove slams into me 
to the ground with her knees 
fast but clove means to savor the moment even 
feels she has time no doubt cato is somewhere 
peeta 
hanging on she asks 
now hunting cato i snarl at her then i scream at 
clove jams her fist into my windpipe very effectively 
side to side and i know for a moment shes at least 
appears to save me she turns back to me 
knows where he cut him youve probably got him 
heart going whats in the pretty little backpack that 
clove opens her jacket its lined with an impressive 
dainty looking number with a cruel curved blade i 
audience a good show 
no use shes too heavy and her lock on me too tight 
just like we did your pathetic little ally    what was 
rue well first rue then you and then i think well 
sound clove asks now where to start 
she carelessly wipes away the blood from my wound 
face tilting it from side to side as if its a block of 
on it i attempt to bite her hand but she grabs the 
ground i think  she almost purrs i think well 
she teasingly traces the outline of my lips with the tip 
i wont close my eyes the comment about rue has 
some dignity as my last act of defiance i will stare 
be an extended period of time but i will stare her 
way undefeated 
anymore want to blow lover boy one last kiss she 
spit it in her face she flushes with rage all right 
i brace myself for the agony thats sure to follow but 
form yanks clove from my body and then shes 
process what has happened has peeta somehow 
some wild animal to add to the fun has a hovercraft 
but when i push myself up on my numb arms i see 
ground imprisoned in threshs arms i let out a gasp 
like a rag doll i remember him as big but he seems 
more massive more powerful than i even recall if 
arena he flips clove around and flings her onto the 
when he shouts i jump never having heard him 
girl you kill her 
frantic insect too shocked to even call for cato no 
you said her name i heard you you kill her 
features you cut her up like you were going to cut 
no no i —  clove sees the stone about the size of a 
cato she screeches cato 
can tell that much to do her any good what was he 
lying in wait for thresh and just badly misjudged his 
thresh brings the rock down hard against cloves 
skull and i know that shes a goner theres still life in 
chest the low moan escaping her lips 
know its no good to run and my bow is empty the 
trapped in the glare of his strange golden brown eyes 
 
to save her i did but he got there first district one 
choose some slow sadistic end for me 
yes i killed him and buried her in flowers i 
tears spring in my eyes the tension the fight goes 
rue and the pain in my head and my fear of thresh 
to sleep thresh says gruffly 
district they sent me bread my hand reaches up 
to wipe my nose do it fast okay thresh 
the rock and points at me almost accusingly just 
me were even then no more owed you 
i nod because i do understand about owing about 
to go back and face a district that has already broken 
to thank me too and i understand that for the 
clove catos voice is much nearer now i can tell by 
you better run now fire girl says thresh 
i dont need to be told twice i flip over and my feet dip 
and clove and the sound of catos voice only when i 
and both large backpacks are vanishing over the edge 
beside clove spear in hand begging her to stay with 
be saved i crash into the trees repeatedly swiping 
the wild wounded creature i am after a few minutes 
that cato will be on one of our trails either threshs 
wound shaking i load an arrow but cato can throw 
only one thing calms me down thresh has catos 
if i had to bet cato headed out after thresh not me 
plunge right in boots still on and flounder 
using for gloves and press them into my forehead 
in minutes 
through the rocks in the dappled light i pull the 
clasp and dump the contents on the ground one 
hesitating i jam the needle into peetas arm and 
my hands go to my head and then drop to my lap 
 
green and silver moth landing on the curve of my 
 
gently pulls me toward consciousness i fight to 
blankets safe at home im vaguely aware that my 
allowed to stay in bed even though i can tell ive been 
cheek and i dont push it away as i would in 
crave that gentle touch how much i miss her even 
wrong voice not my mothers and im scared 
my eyes open and the sense of security vanishes im 
cave my bare feet freezing despite the cover the air 
haggard pale face of a boy slides into view and after 
hey he says good to see your eyes again 
not sure i woke up yesterday evening and you were 
says i think its stopped finally but i wouldnt sit up 
i gingerly lift my hand to my head and find it 
dizzy peeta holds a bottle to my lips and i drink 
 
much better whatever you shot into my arm did the 
swelling in my leg was gone 
drugging him and running off to the feast maybe im 
stronger but for the moment hes all gentleness 
im sorry to say i gobbled down three pieces of that 
while dont worry im back on a strict diet he says 
say 
take care of you for a while 
me bites of groosling and raisins and makes me drink 
feet and wraps them in his jacket before tucking the 
your boots and socks are still damp and the 
of thunder and i see lightning electrify the sky 
several holes in the ceiling but peeta has built a sort 
the square of plastic into the rock above me 
the target says peeta 
cato and thresh i say without thinking foxface 
me an then my voice trails off 
says did you kill her 
lucky he didnt catch you too says peeta 
sick he did but he let me go then of course i 
because he was too sick to ask and i wasnt ready to 
rues dying and the boy from district 1 and the 
thresh and how he was paying off a debt of sorts 
anything asks peeta in disbelief 
always had enough but if youd lived in the seam i 
and dont try obviously im too dim to get it 
owing you for that i say 
says i think we can let that go i mean you just 
but you didnt know me we had never even spoken 
pay back i wouldnt even have been here to do it if 
you hadnt helped me then i say why did you 
why you know why peeta says i give my head a 
a lot of convincing 
nothing peeta says so cato and thresh huh i 
simultaneously destroy each other 
like thresh i think hed be our friend back in district 
then lets hope cato kills him so we dont have 
i dont want cato to kill thresh at all i dont want 
of thing that victors go around saying in the arena 
pool in my eyes 
a lot of pain 
but can be taken as a brief moment of weakness 
i say plaintively like a small child 
me a kiss 
 
home and you 11 be there for real before you know 
okay i whisper wake me if you need me to keep 
im good and rested thanks to you and haymitch 
what does he mean the storm the brief respite ii 
im ion sad and tired to ask 
turned to a downpour sending streams of water 
drips peeta has placed the broth pot under the worst 
from me i feel a bit better able to sit up without 
peeta its clear hes been waiting for me to wake up to 
theres not much left two pieces of groosling a small 
should we try and ration it peeta asks 
anyway and the last thing we need is to get sick 
piles we tryand eat slowly but were both so hungry 
no way satisfied tomorrows a hunting day i say 
never hunted before 
ill kill and you cook i say and you can always 
i wish there was some sort of bread bush out 
the bread they sent me from district eleven was still 
him a couple of mint leaves and pop a few in my own 
its hard to even see the projection in the sky but its 
today so cato and thresh havent had it out yet 
of the circle i ask peeta 
high as my shoulders i dont know maybe some of 
but there are no paths says peeta 
which ones too i say did you go in there 
that grass it has a sinister feeling to it every time i 
snakes and rabid animals and quicksand peeta 
i dont say so but peetas words remind me of the 
fence in district 121 cant help for a moment 
a potential source of food as well as a threat thresh 
hes proved hes not a coward but there are things 
you dont question too much i guess when your 
questions everything what would peeta think of the 
the law each day would it shock him the things we 
maybe there is a bread bush in that field i 
than when we started the games 
peeta i wonder what wed have to do to get haymitch 
i raise my eyebrows before i remember he doesnt 
of nights ago one kiss equals one pot of broth its 
thoughts aloud would be tipping off the audience that 
sympathies and that would result in no food at all 
track something simple to start with i reach out and 
well he probably used up a lot of resources helping 
yeah about that says peeta entwining his fingers 
or what i ask 
give me a minute 
 
reinforces the idea in your mind that you did the right 
i did do the right thing i say 
my hand and theres real anger in his voice dont 
right 
opportunity for getting food so i try to keep up 
that maybe you arent the only one who    who 
i fumble im not as smooth with words as peeta and 
hit me again and i realized how much i dont want 
not about what will happen back home and its not 
want to lose the boy with the bread 
i wish i could pull the shutters closed blocking out 
means losing food whatever im feeling its no ones 
thats exactly the kind of topic haymitch told me to 
never said anything of the kind in fact hes probably 
such an emotionally charged moment but peeta 
 
says and moves in to me 
neither of us hobbled by sickness or pain or simply 
icy cold this is the first kiss where i actually feel 
the first kiss that makes me want another 
just a light one on the tip of my nose because peetas 
again come on lie down its bedtime anyway he 
my socks are dry enough to wear now i make peeta 
right down to my bones so he must be half frozen i 
of us think its likely anyone will come in this 
too and im shivering so hard that its pointless to 
peeta was a million miles away im struck by his 
down to use his arm as a pillow the other rests 
one has held me like this in such a long time since 
one elses arms have made me feel this safe 
water splatter on the cave floor rhythmic and lulling 
guilty and angry with myself after three or four 
cant keep my eyes open he doesnt seem to mind 
tomorrow when its dry 111 find us a place so high 
i drift off 
deluge continues as if the gamemakers are intent on 
seems to shake the ground peetas considering 
him in this storm it would be pointless he wont be 
end up getting soaked to the skin for his troubles he 
becoming painful 
break in the weather haymitch is our only hope but 
everything will cost an exorbitant amount — or 
probably the latter id be the first to admit were not 
trying not to reopen wounds were sitting huddled 
to keep warm the most exciting thing either of us 
im not really sure how to ramp up the romance the 
will take some forethought there are girls in the 
these waters so easily but ive never had much time 
anymore clearly because if it was wed have gotten 
just looking for physical affection he wants 
trying to get me to tell about myself when we were 
 
talking 
had a crush on me forever when did forever start 
five you had on a red plaid dress and your hair  it 
you out when we were waiting to line up peeta says 
he said see that little girl i wanted to marry her 
says 
no true story peeta says and i said a coal 
had you and he said because when he sings  
thats true they do i mean they did i say im 
baker telling this to peeta it strikes me that my own 
not really be that i think its a waste of time it might 
so that day in music assembly the teacher asked 
the air she stood you up on a stool and had you sing 
fell silent peeta says 
 
knew — just like your mother — i was a goner peeta 
up the nerve to talk to you 
without success so in a way my name being drawn 
for a moment im almost foolishly happy and then 
be making up this stuff playing at being in love not 
truth to it that part about my father and the birds 
remember the song and that red plaid dress    there 
rags after my fathers death 
beating to give me the bread on that awful hollow day 
you have a  remarkable memory i say haltingly 
tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear youre 
i am now i say 
i want to draw away to close those shutters again 
whispering in my ear say it say it 
i swallow hard and get the words out you dont have 
who leans in 
outside makes us jump my bow comes up the arrow 
through the rocks and then gives a whoop before i 
something in to me a silver parachute attached to a 
— fresh rolls goat cheese apples and best of all a 
very dish i told caesar flickerman was the most 
peeta wriggles back inside his face lit up like the sun 
starve 
but in my head i can hear haymitch s smug if 
looking lot sweetheart 
every cell in my body wants me to dig into the stew 
peetas voice stops me we better take it slow on that 
food made me sick and i wasnt even starving then 
thingi say regretfully but i dont we are quite 
egg size serving of stew and rice i make myself eat 
silverware and plates — savoring each bite when we 
me too tell you what we wait an hour if it stays 
agreed i say its going to be a long hour 
you were saying just before the food arrived 
that ever happened to you  
dim in here for the cameras to pick up my blush 
scoot over im freezing 
back against the cave wall my head on his shoulder 
nudging me to keep up the act so since we were 
five you never even noticed any other girls i ask 
no i noticed just about every girl but none of them 
im sure that would thrill your parents you liking a 
hardly but i couldnt care less anyway if we make 
girl from the victors village he says 
part of town reserved for hunger games victors long 
dozen fine houses in each district of course in ours 
been lived in at all 
neighbor will be haymitch 
around me you and me and haymitch very cozy 
retelling old hunger games tales 
laughing at the image of haymitch becoming my new 
only sometimes when hes sober ive never heard 
hes never sober i protest 
cinna who likes you but thats mainly because you 
didnt try to run when he set you on fire says peeta 
id avoid haymitch completely he hates you 
he hates me more says peeta i dont think people 
i know the audience will enjoy our having fun at 
hes practically an old friend to some of them and 
everybody knows him by this time theyll have 
about us no telling what sort of lies hes made up 
mentors have a partner another victor to help them 
any moment kind of like me when i was alone in the 
drinking the attention and the stress of trying to 
its funny haymitch and i dont get along well in 
because he seems able to communicate with me by 
close to water when he withheld it and how i knew 
pain and how i know now that i have to play up the 
peeta really perhaps he thinks a bowl of broth would 
strings attached to it 
taken so long to surface maybe its because ive only 
recently begun to view haymitch with a degree of 
who did what peeta asks 
say 
haymitch is sturdily built but no physical wonder 
not in the way that causes sponsors to rain gifts on 
teaming up with him theres only one way haymitch 
this conclusion myself 
i nod then let the conversation drop but secretly im 
help peeta and me because he thought we just might 
drunk maybe in the beginning he tried to help the 
mentor two kids and then watch them die year after 
will become my job to mentor the girl from district 
about half an hour has passed before i decide i have 
argument while im dishing up two more small 
begin to play peeta presses his eyes against a crack 
 
more interested in the stew than the sky nothings 
katniss peeta says quietly 
katniss he repeats but i find myself wanting to 
im going to split one but 111 save the cheese for 
thresh is dead says peeta 
they must have fired the cannon during the thunder 
are you sure i mean its pouring buckets out there 
him away from the rocks and squint out into the 
distorted glimpse of threshs picture and then hes 
i slump down against the rocks momentarily 
should be happy right one less tribute to face and 
about is thresh letting me go letting me run because 
you all right asks peeta 
hands hugging them close to my body i have to bury 
the real pain because whos going to bet on a tribute 
rue was one thing we were allies she was so young 
murder the word pulls me up short murder 
win me any points in the arena what i do say is its 
he let me go and because of rue 
step closer to district twelve he nudges a plate of 
i take a bite of the stew to show i dont really care 
to swallow it also means cato will be back hunting 
and hes got supplies again says peeta 
what makes you say that peeta asks 
without a fight hes so strong i mean he was and 
good says peeta the more wounded cato is the 
oh shes fine i say peevishly im still angry she 
probably be easier to catch cato than her 
home says peeta but we better be extra careful 
 
we finish our food in silence and then peeta offers to 
bag next to him pulling my hood up over my face to 
of privacy where i can let any emotion cross my face 
goodbye to thresh and thank him for my life i 
to help his family and rues if i win then i escape 
warmth of peeta beside me 
the smell of goat cheese hes holding out half a roll 
apple slices dont be mad he says i had to eat 
oh good i say immediately taking a huge bite the 
makes the apples are sweet and crunchy mm 
he says 
too expensive for my family to eat unless its gone 
stale says peeta pulling the sleeping bag up around 
huh i always assumed the shopkeepers live a soft 
and its true peeta has always had enough to eat 
 
one else wanted one thing about us since i bring 
you have to make sure it isnt going to make a run for 
somewhere during my shift the rain stops not 
theres only the residual drippings of water from 
below us a full beautiful moon emerges and even 
the moon is real or merely a projection of the 
home gale and i watched it rise as we hunted into 
how long have i been gone im guessing its been 
week of preparation in the capitol maybe the moon 
want it to be my moon the same one i see from the 
something to cling to in the surreal world of the arena 
four of us left 
the possibility that i might make it home to fame to 
mother and prim would live there with me no more 
what what would my life be like on a daily basis 
food take that away and im not really sure who i 
think of haymitch with all his money what did his 
 
that 
my mother and prim well for the time being and 
has grown up my mother passed away i know 111 
world because if theres one thing being a victor 
names would go right into the reaping balls with 
the sun eventually rises its light slipping through the 
transform into if we make it home this perplexing 
convincingly the whole of panem believes him to be 
moments when he makes me believe it myself at 
fact that weve saved each others lives in here and 
good friends any thing beyond that though  and i 
the way from district 12 
peetas shoulder his eyes open sleepily and when 
were wasting hunting time i say when i finally 
i wouldnt call it wasting he says giving a big 
stomachs to give us an edge 
not us i say we stuff ourselves to give us staying 
count me in peeta says but i can see hes 
and hand a heaping plate to him all this 
into our plates even cold its one of the best things 
last dabs of gravy with my finger i can feel effie 
hey effie watch this says peeta he tosses his fork 
with his tongue making loud satisfied sounds then 
miss you effie 
stop cato could be right outside our cave 
to protect me now says peeta pulling me to him 
from his grasp but not before he gets in another kiss 
our mood shifts to serious its as though for the last 
catos preoccupation with thresh we were given a 
sunny and warm we both sense were really back in 
weapons he once had are long gone and he slips it 
sacrificed three in the explosion two at the feast — 
rattle a bit too loosely in the quiver i cant afford to 
hell be hunting us by now says peeta cato isnt 
if hes wounded —  i begin 
hes coming 
several feet on either side we stop there to replenish 
up empty not surprising with the weather besides i 
area 
hunting grounds i say 
peeta says 
as possible no sense in leaving him tracks to follow 
the explosion destroyed the hearing in my left ear for 
id walk in the water to cover our tracks completely 
although the drugs have erased the infection hes 
cut but after three days the bleeding has stopped i 
physical exertion should bring it back 
as we head up alongside the stream we pass the 
and mud one good thing between the downpour and 
been wiped out that means that if need be we can 
with cato after us 
to pebbles and then to my relief were back on pine 
the first time i realize we have a problem navigating 
naturally going to make some noise but even on the 
meanloudloud as if hes stomping his feet or 
what he asks 
cato youre chasing off every rabbit in a tenmile 
really he says sorry i didnt know 
even with only one working ear hes making me 
can you take your boots off i suggest 
walk barefoot on hot coals or something i have to 
that its the scary forbidden place beyond the fences 
its eerie how little sound he makes even when the 
 
laughing back home 
be quieter like i was making any noise so we both 
improvement i could swear hes making an effort to 
needless to say although it takes several hours to 
stream would settle down fish might be an option 
and drink water i try to work out a solution ideally 
chore and go hunt but then hed be left with only a 
superior strength so what id really like is to try and 
back and collect him but i have a feeling his ego isnt 
katniss he says we need to split up i know im 
only because your legs hurt i say generously 
the problem 
some plants to gather and that way well both be 
not if cato comes and kills you i tried to say it in a 
weakling 
cato i fought him before didnt i 
yeah and that turned out great you ended up dying 
he did save my life by taking on cato after all i try 
acted as a lookout while i hunted i say trying to 
what if you show me whats edible around here and 
just dont go far in case you need help 
food no question one apple two rolls and a blob of 
short distance and hope cato is a long way off 
but a simple twonote whistle — which we can use to 
good at this leaving him with the pack i head off 
of the fence but to peeta allowing myself twenty 
though the woods come alive with animal sounds 
drift farther away and soon have two rabbits and a 
set snares and maybe get some fish with peetas 
as i travel the short distance back i realize we 
whistle receives no response i run in no time i find 
plastic has been laid on the ground where the sun 
but where is he 
peeta i call out in a panic peeta i turn to the 
him fortunately i pull my bow at the last second 
back flinging a handful of berries into the foliage 
youre supposed to be here not running around in 
i found some berries down by the stream he says 
i whistled why didnt you whistle backisnap at 
i didnt hear the waters too loud i guess he says 
thats when i feel that im trembling 
no im fine peeta wraps his arms around me but i 
i push away trying to sort out my feelings if two 
if one of them doesnt answer theyre in trouble all 
all right he says 
and i watched her die i say i turn away from him 
although i still have some in mine but im not ready 
are untouched but someones definitely picked away 
 
about 
oh and i suppose the apples ate the cheese i say 
and distinctly as if trying not to lose his temper but 
berries would you care for some 
do walk over and look at them ive never seen this 
arent rues berries although they resemble them 
lean down and scoop up a few rolling them between 
my fathers voice comes back to me not these 
before they reach your stomach 
peeta to collapse to the ground but he only raises his 
so away whats left of foxfaces emaciated body is 
the sunlight 
cheese  
tree climb hell be here in a second well stand a 
 
not catos 
says how could i have killed her 
 
foxface stole the food from the supply pile before i 
but not enough that anyone would notice it how she 
preparing to eat ourselves 
guess if im as loud as you say 
but i try to be kind and shes very clever peeta 
not on purpose doesnt seem fair somehow i mean 
eaten the berries first he checks himself no of 
you 
even the name sounds deadly he says im sorry 
youd gathered 
home right i ask 
sheet of blue plastic careful to trap the berries inside 
wait i cry i find the leather pouch that belonged to 
 
maybe they can fool cato as well if hes chasing us or 
pouch and if he eats them —  
thats it i say securing the pouch to my belt 
anywhere nearby and saw that hovercraft hell know 
peetas right this could be just the opportunity 
theres the meat to cook and our fire will be another 
now i begin to gather branches and brush 
im ready to eat better to cook our food while we 
but he also knows theres two of us and probably 
recovered and the fire means were not hiding were 
maybe not he says 
damp wood in no time i have the rabbits and 
in the coals we take turns gathering greens and 
he doesnt make an appearance 
us each a rabbits leg to eat as we walk 
i want to move higher into the woods climb a good 
i cant climb like you katniss especially with my leg 
above the ground 
cant we go back to the cave he asks its near 
i sigh several more hours of walking — or should i 
well just have to leave in the morning to hunt but 
instructions all day and im sure if things were 
tree it dawns on me that i havent been very nice to 
screaming at him over disappearing the playful 
disappeared out in the open under the hot sun with 
probably just about had it with me and as for the 
i reach up and give him a kiss sure lets go back to 
he looks pleased and relieved well that was easy 
the shaft these arrows are food safety and life itself 
we toss a bunch more wood on the fire it should be 
doubt cato assumes anything at this point when we 
 
suggest we walk back in it peetas happy to oblige 
a doubly good idea its a long walk back to the cave 
give us a boost were both exhausted by our hike 
loaded both for cato and any fish i might see but the 
by the time we reach our destination our feet are 
up our water bottles and climb the little slope to our 
the closest thing we have to a home it will be warmer 
from the wind that has begun to blow steadily in from 
peeta begins to nod off after days of inactivity the 
bag and set aside the rest of his food for when he 
bag up to his chin and kiss his forehead not for the 
hes still here not dead by the stream as id thought 
brutal bloody cato who can snap a neck with a twist 
who has had it out for me since the beginning he 
outscored him in training a boy like peeta would 
cato to distraction which is not that hard i think of 
up the others were upset of course but he was 
be entirely sane 
the sky lights up with the seal and i watch foxface 
forever he hasnt said it but i dont think peeta felt 
pretend ill miss her but i have to admire her my 
would have been the smartest of all the tributes if in 
have sensed it and avoided the berries it was peetas 
much time making sure i dont underestimate my 
overestimate them as well 
a sense of foxface who she was and how she 
trained but smart i dont know not like she was 
demonstrated i believe cato could easily lose his 
superior on that point i think of the moment i sent 
when i was so enraged maybe i do understand cato 
despite the fatigue in my body my minds alert so i 
soft gray day has begun when i shake his shoulder 
night thats not fair katniss you should have woken 
i stretch and burrow down into the bag ill sleep 
apparently nothing does because when i open my 
rocks any sign of our friend i ask 
peeta shakes his head no hes keeping a 
how long do you think well have before the 
well foxface died almost a day ago so theres been 
bored i guess it could happen at any moment says 
yeah i have a feeling todays the day i say i sit up 
theyll do it 
answer 
day but we should probably eat as much as we can 
peeta packs up our gear while i lay out a big meal 
with the last bit of cheese the only thing i leave in 
by the time were done all thats left is a pile of rabbit 
growing feeling of grubbiness maybe we dont bathe 
late except for my feet which have walked in the 
leaving the cave has a sense of finality about it i 
somehow one way or the other dead or alive i have 
goodbye and we head down to the stream to wash 
up i can feel my skin itching for the cool water i 
if we might even be able to give our clothes a quick 
the stream now theres only a bonedry bed i put my 
not even a little damp they must have drained it 
aching body and fuzzy mind brought on by my 
our bottles and skin are fairly full but with two 
them 
go 
we can check he says but hes just humoring me 
when we return to the pond where i soaked my leg a 
anyway just to confirm what we already know 
where theres no cover where theyre guaranteed a 
view do you want to go straightaway or wait until 
lets go now while weve had food and rest lets just 
i nod its funny i feel almost as if its the first day of 
twentyone tributes are dead but i still have yet to 
 
obstacles distractions keeping us from the real 
but no theres the boy waiting beside me i feel his 
two against one should be a piece of cake he says 
you bet it will he says 
each other the sunlight the rustle of the leaves at 
head for the lake 
scurrying make birds take wing we have to fight 
but i doubt ill have that choice if the gamemakers 
we stop to rest for a few moments under the tree 
tracker jacker nest beaten to a pulp by the heavy 
location i touch it with the tip of my boot and it 
breeze i cant help looking up in the tree where rue 
j ackers glimmers bloated body the terrifying 
lets move on i say wanting to escape the darkness 
 
plain its already early evening theres no sign of 
glowing in the slanting sun rays just in case cato 
cornucopia to make sure its empty then obediently 
fill our water containers 
him after dark theres only the one pair of glasses 
water maybe thats what hes waiting for what do 
either that or find a tree but lets give him another 
we sit by the lake in full sight theres no point in 
see the mockingjays flitting about bouncing melodies 
balls i open my mouth and sing out rues fournote 
my voice listening for more i repeat the notes in the 
then another then the whole world comes alive with 
just like your father says peeta 
song i say i think they remember it 
as the notes overlap they compliment one another 
sound then thanks to rue that sent the orchard 
workers of district 1 1 home each night does 
she is dead 
mesmerized by the beauty of the song then 
in jagged imperfect lines dissonant notes intersperse 
shrieking cry of alarm 
to shoot when cato smashes through the trees and 
are empty yet he runs straight for us my first arrow 
hes got some kind of body armor i shout to peeta 
myself but he rockets right between us with no 
panting the sweat pouring off his purplish face that 
from something but what 
creature leap onto the plain as im turning away i 
blindly after cato with no thought of anything but to 
 
these mutts but theyre no naturalborn animals 
then balances easily on its hind legs what wolf 
as though it had a wrist these things i can see at a 
attributes will be revealed 
without question i follow him if he thinks its the 
could make it to the trees it would be impossible for 
have just landed on the metal at the pointed tail of 
hes about fifteen yards behind me hobbling as fast 
send an arrow into the pack and one goes down but 
peetas waving me up the horn go katniss go 
start climbing scaling the cornucopia on my hands 
resemble the woven horn that we fill at harvest so 
on but after a day in the arena sun the metal feels 
cato lies on his side at the very top of the horn 
breath as he gags over the edge nows my chance to 
 
hear peeta cry out i twist around and see hes just 
climb i yell peeta starts up hampered by not only 
down the throat of the first mutt that places its paws 
inadvertently opening gashes on a few of its 
four inches and clearly razorsharp 
him along then i remember cato waiting at the top 
and apparently more preoccupied with the mutts 
snuffling growling sound coming from the mutts isnt 
what i shout at him 
my focus back to the base of the horn 
together they raise up again to stand easily on their 
has a thick coat some with fur that is straight and 
to what i can only describe as blond theres 
the hair rise up on the back of my neck but i cant 
they put their snouts on the horn sniffing and 
then making highpitched yipping sounds to one 
 
one of them a goodsize mutt with silky waves of 
horn its back legs must be incredibly powerful 
lips pulled back in a snarl for a moment it hangs 
unsettled me about the mutts the green eyes 
canine ive ever seen they are unmistakably human 
notice the collar with the number 1 inlaid with jewels 
the green eyes the number  its glimmer 
holding the arrow in place i have been waiting to fire 
waiting to see if the creatures can in fact climb but 
backward unable to find any purchase on the metal 
claws like nails on a blackboard i fire into its throat 
thud 
its her i get out 
my head snaps from side to side as i examine the 
small one with the red coat and amber eyes    
the boy from district 9 who died as we struggled for 
with dark glossy fur huge brown eyes and a collar 
that reads 1 1 in woven straw teeth bared in hatred 
what is it katniss peeta shakes my shoulder 
foxface and  all of the other tributes i choke out 
to them you dont think    those could be their real 
their eyes are the least of my worries what about 
tributes memories have they been programmed to 
and they were so callously murdered and the ones 
their own deaths 
assault on the horn theyve split into two groups at 
hindquarters to launch themselves at us a pair of 
then i hear peeta cry out feel the yank on his body 
side if not for the grip on my arm hed be on the 
us both on the curved back of the horn and more 
kill it peeta kill it im shouting and although i 
have stabbed the thing because the pull lessens im 
ourselves toward the top where the lesser of two evils 
 
is slowing and i know soon hell be recovered enough 
i arm my bow but the arrow ends up taking out a 
so high i feel a moments relief because we must 
back to face cato when peetas jerked from my side 
splatters my face 
holding peeta in some kind of headlock cutting off his 
confused over whether its more important to breathe 
hole a mutt left in his calf 
knowing it 11 have no effect on his trunk or limbs 
colored mesh some highgrade body armor from the 
body armor to defend against my arrows well they 
cato just laughs shoot me and he goes down with 
hes right if i take him out and he falls to the mutts 
stalemate i cant shoot cato without killing peeta 
in his brain we stand like statues both of us seeking 
my muscles are strained so tightly they feel they 
 
i can hear is the blood pounding in my good ear 
quickly hell die of asphyxiation and then 111 have 
weapon against me in fact im sure this is catos 
set in a triumphant smile 
dripping with blood from his leg up to catos arm 
veers off and makes a deliberate x on the back of 
second after i do i can tell by the way the smile drops 
that time my arrow is piercing his hand he cries out 
him for a horrible moment i think theyre both going 
cato loses his footing on the bloodslick horn and 
we hear him hit the air leaving his body on impact 
each other waiting for the cannon waiting for the 
doesnt happen not yet because this is the climax of 
i dont watch but i can hear the snarls the growls 
takes on the mutt pack i cant understand how he 
protecting him from ankle to neck and i realize what a 
sword or something too something he had hidden in 
 
the blade collides with the golden horn the combat 
cato must be attempting the one maneuver that 
the tail of the horn and rejoin us but in the end 
simply overpowered 
so when cato hits the ground and we hear the mutts 
cornucopia now theyll finish him off i think but 
night falls and the anthem plays and theres no 
coming through the metal beneath us the icy air 
are not over and may not be for who knows how long 
i turn my attention to peeta and discover his leg is 
remain down by the lake where we abandoned them 
nothing to staunch the flow of blood from his calf 
jacket remove my shirt and zip back into the jacket 
teeth chattering beyond control 
lie down before i probe his wound warm slippery 
enough ive seen my mother tie a tourniquet a 
sleeve from my shirt wrap it twice around his leg just 
 
the knot twisting it as tightly as i dare its risky 
when i weigh this against him losing his life what 
of my shirt and lay down with him 
exactly medical protocol but im terrified that if he 
are you cold he asks he unzips his jacket and i 
bit warmer sharing our body heat inside my double 
temperature will continue to drop 
when i first climbed it slowly turning to ice 
dont you believe it he says pulling up my hood 
the next hours are the worst in my life which if you 
torture enough but the real nightmare is listening to 
as the mutts work away at him after a very short 
want is for his suffering to end 
you know why he says and pulls me closer to him 
and i do no viewer could turn away from the show 
final word in entertainment 
consumes my mind blocking out memories and 
present which i begin to believe will never change 
the agonized sounds of the boy dying in the horn 
find myself yelling his name louder and louder 
completely insane hes fighting it probably more for 
unconsciousness would be its own form of escape 
never allow me to follow him so i cant let him go i 
the only indication of the passage of time lies in the 
pointing it out to me insisting i acknowledge its 
flicker of hope before the agony of the night engulfs 
finally i hear him whisper that the sun is rising i 
light of dawn i can see too how bloodless peetas 
know i have to get him back to the capitol 
the horn and can just make out catos voice 
himpeeta asks 
if hes near the mouth i may be able to take him out 
my last arrows in your tourniquet i say 
letting me loose 
tightly as my frozen fingers can manage i rub my 
crawl to the lip of the horn and hang over the edge i 
it takes a few moments to find cato in the dim light 
be my enemy makes a sound and i know where his 
please 
skull peeta pulls me back up bow in hand quiver 
did you get him he whispers 
then we won katniss he says hollowly 
in my voice 
remaining mutts bound into it disappearing as the 
 
the trumpets of victory that should follow but 
hey i shout into air whats going on the only 
maybe its the body maybe we have to move away 
i try to remember do you have to distance yourself 
muddled to be sure but what else could be the 
okay think you could make it to the lake i ask 
tail of the horn and fall to the ground if the stiffness 
rise first swinging and bending my arms and legs 
back to the lake i scoop up a handful of the cold 
a mockingjay gives the long low whistle and tears of 
catos body away now they will take us now we can 
but again theres no response 
between the loss of the tourniquet and the effort it 
again 
watch him lose any more blood i get up to find a 
stick but almost immediately come across the arrow 
as the other arrow as i stoop to pick it up claudius 
greetings to the final contestants of the seventy 
revoked closer examination of the rule book has 
says good luck and may the odds be ever in your 
theres a small burst of static and then nothing more 
never intended to let us both live this has all been 
dramatic showdown in history and like a fool i 
if you think about it its not that surprising he 
feet then hes moving toward me as if in slow 
before i am even aware of my actions my bow is 
peeta raises his eyebrows and i see the knife has 
splashes in the water i drop my weapons and take a 
shame 
thrusts the weapons back in my hands 
do it before they send those mutts back or 
 
weapons back at him you shoot me and go home 
here right now would be the easier of the two 
weapons fine ill go first anyway he leans down 
barrier between his blood and the earth 
desperately plastering the bandage back onto his 
katniss he says its what i want 
he dies 111 never go home not really ill spend the 
out 
know they have to have a victor it can only be one of 
how he loves me what life would be without me but 
trapped in my head thrashing desperately around 
yes they have to have a victor without a victor the 
theyd have failed the capitol might possibly even be 
broadcast it to every screen in the country 
were  
my fingers fumble with the pouch on my belt freeing 
no i wont let you 
moment then lets me go i loosen the top of the pouch 
then i fill my own on the count of three 
the count of three he says 
hands locked tight 
i spread out my fingers and the dark berries glisten 
signal as a goodbye and we begin counting one 
both die three its too late to change my mind i lift 
world the berries have just passed my lips when the 
the frantic voice of claudius templesmith shouts 
pleased to present the victors of the seventyfourth 
give you — the tributes of district twelve 
i spew the berries from my mouth wiping my tongue 
remains peeta pulls me to the lake where we both 
each others arms 
he shakes his head you 
lips moving in reply but i cant hear him over the 
live over the speakers 
drop only theres no way im letting go of peeta i 
each place a foot on the first rung of the ladder the 
glad because im not really sure peeta can hang on for 
i can see that while our muscles are immobile 
peetas leg sure enough the minute the door closes 
floor unconscious 
tightly that when they take him away it tears leaving 
white masked and gloved already prepped to 
silver table tubes and wires springing out of him 
 
threat one more pack of mutts designed to kill him 
back into another room and a glass door seals 
off everyone ignores me except for some capitol 
beverage 
staring uncomprehendingly at the crystal glass in my 
frilly white collar how wrong it looks in my bloody 
mouth waters at the smell but i place it carefully on 
through the glass i see the doctors working 
concentration i see the flow of liquids pumping 
that mean nothing to me im not sure but i think his 
its like being home again when they bring in the 
or the woman in her third day of labor or the 
mother and prim they wear that same look on their 
hide in the trees until the patient is long gone and in 
coffin but im held here both by the hovercraft walls 
dying how often ive seen them ringed around our 
why do they stay to watch 
 
only a few inches away and then realize its my own 
cheeks my hair in a tangled mat rabid feral mad 
me 
of the training center and theyre taking peeta but 
against the glass shrieking and i think i just catch a 
effie coming to my rescue — when the needle jabs me 
when i wake im afraid to move at first the entire 
see that im in a room containing just my bed no 
something sharp and antiseptic my right arm has 
naked but the bedclothes arc soothing against my 
not only has it been scrubbed clean the nails are 
less prominent i touch my cheek my lips the 
running my fingers through my silken hair when i 
no it wasnt an illusion i can hear again 
band around my waist keeps me from rising more 
me panic and im trying to pull myself up and wriggle 
slides open and in steps the redheaded avox girl 
trying to escape i want to ask her a million 
questions but im afraid any familiarity would cause 
she sets the tray across my thighs and presses 
she adjusts my pillows i risk one question i say it 
nothing will seem secretive did peeta make it she 
hand i feel the pressure of friendship 
has made it of course he did with all their 
until now 
her and i turn hungrily to the tray a bowl of clear 
water this is it i think grouchily shouldnt my 
i find its an effort to finish the spare meal before me 
chestnut and i have to wonder how long ive been out 
breakfast that last morning in the arena theres 
competition and the presentation of the victor so that 
back together again somewhere cinna and portia 
appearances haymitch and effie will be arranging 
for our final interviews back home district 12 is 
homecoming celebrations for peeta and me given that 
 
of prims scruffy old cat makes me smile soon i will 
i want to get out of this bed to see peeta and cinna 
shouldnt i i feel fine but as i start to work my way 
vein from one of the tubes and almost immediately 
this happens on and off for an indeterminate amount 
the impulse to try and escape the bed being knocked 
twilight only a few things register the redheaded 
are disappearing and do i imagine it or do i hear a 
the rougher cadences of home and i cant help 
looking out for me 
theres nothing plugged into my right arm the 
am free to move about i start to sit up but am 
perfection smooth and glowing not only are the 
over years of hunting have vanished without a trace 
burn on my calf theres nothing 
bear my weight and find them strong and steady 
flinch its what all of us tributes wore in the arena i 
stare at it as if it had teeth until i remember that of 
im dressed in less than a minute and fidgeting in 
cant see it when suddenly it slides open i step into a 
doors on it but it must and behind one of them 
im growing more and more anxious about him he 
so but i need to see him for myself 
my name in response but its not his voice its a 
effie 
the end of the hall — effie haymitch and cinna my 
show more restraint more superiority especially 
i run for them and surprise even myself when i 
in my ear nice job sweetheart it doesnt sound 
my hair and talking about how she told everyone we 
anything then i notice portia is absent and get a bad 
wheres portia is she with peeta he is all right 
hes fine only they want to do your reunion live on 
 
peetas dead again passes i guess id want to see 
go on with cinna he has to get you ready says 
its a relief to be alone with cinna to feel his 
away from the cameras down a few passages and to 
center the hospital then is far underground even 
knots and throwing spears the windows of the lobby 
no one else is there to see us cross to the tribute 
when we ride up to the twelfth floor the faces of all 
mind and theres a heavy tight place in my chest 
octavia engulf me talking so quickly and ecstatically 
though they are truly thrilled to see me and im 
cinna its more in the way one might be glad to see 
difficult day 
meal — roast beef and peas and soft rolls — although 
when i ask for seconds im refused 
the stage says octavia but she secretly slips me an 
side 
we go back to my room and cinna disappears for a 
oh they did a full body polish on you says flavius 
but when i look at my naked body in the mirror all i 
worse when i came out of the arena but i can easily 
they take care of the shower settings for me and they 
done they chatter so continuously that i barely have 
talkative its funny because even though theyre 
were or what they were doing or how they felt when a 
had my eyebrows dyed i swear i nearly fainted 
girls in the arena 
district 12 we grit our teeth and watch because we 
possible when theyre over to keep from hating the 
saying 
unassuming yellow dress across his arms 
ask 
immediately notice the padding over my breasts 
adding curves that hunger has stolen from my body 
i know says cinna before i can object but the 
haymitch had a huge fight with them over it this 
at my reflection wait dont forget the shoes venia 
to the mirror 
glows even the slight movement in the air sends a 
costume seems garish the interview dress too 
candlelight 
i think its the best yet i say when i manage to pull 
something of a shock my hairs loose held back by a 
sharp angles of my face a clear polish coats my nails 
waist largely eliminating any help the padding would 
without heels you can see my true stature i look 
most innocent harmless yes it is shocking that 
won the games 
is arbitrary i bite my lip trying to figure out his 
 
looking i say 
carefully 
and the gamemakers and the audience although i do 
games are not quite finished and beneath his benign 
mention in front of his own team 
customary for the victor and his or her support team 
followed by the escort the stylist the mentor and 
share both an escort and a mentor the whole thing 
area under the stage a brandnew metal plate has 
see small piles of sawdust smell fresh paint cinna 
costumes and take their positions leaving me alone 
away and assume peetas behind it 
haymitch until he touches my shoulder i spring 
easy just me lets have a look at you haymitch 
enough 
 
space and he seems to make a decision but 
okay thats an odd request from haymitch but after 
only when i put my arms around his neck i find 
very fast very quietly in my ear my hair concealing 
listen up youre in trouble word is the capitols 
one thing they cant stand is being laughed at and 
i feel dread coursing through me now but i laugh as 
delightful because nothing is covering my mouth so 
your only defense can be you were so madly in love 
pulls back and adjusts my hairband got it 
got it i say did you tell peeta this 
but you think im not i say taking the opportunity 
wrestled him into 
haymitch better take our places he leads me to the 
he kisses me on the forehead and disappears into the 
 
cover the knocking in my knees then i realize its 
hopefully it will be put down to excitement after all 
the damp moldy smell beneath the stage threatens 
skin and i cant rid myself of the feeling that the 
me alive under the rubble when i left the arena 
from then on for the rest of my life but if what 
ive never been in such a dangerous place in my life 
there i could only die end of story but out here 
everyone i care about back home could be punished if 
haymitch has suggested 
when i poured out those berries i was only thinking 
would reflect on the capitol but the hunger games 
to defeat it so now the capitol will act as if theyve 
the whole event right down to the double suicide but 
and peeta  peeta will suffer too if this goes wrong 
told peeta the situation that he had to pretend to be 
dont have to hes already there 
already thinking ahead of me in the games again and 
desperately in love i dont know i havent even 
complicated what i did as part of the games as 
because of how it would be viewed back in district 12 
or what i did because i cared about him 
the peace and quiet of the woods when no one is 
wont have that luxury for who knows how long and 
games is about to begin 
the anthem booms in my ears and then i hear 
know how crucial it is to get every word right from 
breaks into applause as the prep teams are 
bouncing around and taking ridiculous bobbing 
introduced how long shes waited for this moment i 
effie can be she has a very keen instinct about 
trouble portia and cinna receive huge cheers of 
now understand cinna s choice of dress for me for 
possible haymitchs appearance brings a round of 
accomplished a first keeping not only one but two 
would i have acted differently flaunted the moment 
so but i could easily have been a lot less convincing 
the plate lifting me up to the stage 
under my feet then theres peeta just a few yards 
can hardly recognize him but his smile is the same 
take about three steps and fling myself into his arms 
thats when i realize the slim metal contraption in his 
 
insane hes kissing me and all the time im thinking 
in after about ten minutes of this caesar 
show and peeta just pushes him aside without even 
he knows or not peeta is as usual playing the crowd 
finally haymitch interrupts us and gives us a good 
is a single ornate chair from which the winning 
but since there are two of us the gamemakers have 
mother would call it a love seat i think i sit so close 
from haymitch tells me it isnt enough kicking off my 
against peetas shoulder his arm goes around me 
curled up against him trying to keep warm his shirt 
portias put him in long black pants no sandals 
solidly planted on the stage i wish cinna had given 
dress but i guess that was the point 
its time for the show this will last exactly three 
lights dim and the seal appears on the screen i 
my twenty two fellow tributes die i saw enough of 
i have a strong impulse to run how have the other 
 
the corner of the screen i think back to earlier years 
air beating their chests most just seem stunned all 
seat is peeta — his arm around my shoulder his 
previous victors didnt have the capitol looking for a 
condensing several weeks into three hours is quite a 
were going at once whoever puts together the 
this year for the first time they tell a love story i 
of time is spent on us right from the beginning im 
love thing thats my defense for defying the capitol 
over the deaths 
events the reaping the chariot ride through the 
theres this sort of upbeat soundtrack playing under 
almost everyone onscreen is dead 
the bloodbath and then the filmmakers basically 
us mostly peeta really theres no question hes 
see what the audience saw how he misled the 
under the tracker j acker tree fought cato to let me 
whispered my name in his sleep i seem heartless in 
comparison — dodging fireballs dropping nests and 
they play her death in full the spearing my failed 
district 1 s throat rue drawing her last breath in my 
song something inside me shuts down and im too 
strangers in another hunger games but i do notice 
right because even that smacks of rebellion 
tributes from the same district can live and i shout 
mouth if ive seemed indifferent to him earlier i 
to health going to the feast for the medicine and 
the mutts and catos death are as gruesome as ever 
and then comes the moment with the berries i can 
to miss anything a wave of gratitude to the 
the announcement of our victory but with me 
screaming peetas name as they try to revive him 
the anthems playing yet again and we rise as 
little girl carrying a cushion that holds the crown 
crowds confusion — whose head will he place it on 
 
peetas brow with a smile hes still smiling when he 
inches from mine are as unforgiving as a snakes 
would have eaten the berries i am to blame for 
punished 
to fall off from waving when caesar flickerman finally 
in tomorrow for the final interviews as if they have a 
peeta and i are whisked to the presidents mansion 
to eat as capitol officials and particularly generous 
to get their picture with us face after beaming face 
evening wears on occasionally i catch a glimpse of 
which is terrifying but i keep laughing and thanking 
thing i never do is let go of peetas hand 
straggle back to the twelfth floor of the training 
peeta but haymitch sends him off with portia to get 
escorts me to my door 
plenty of time for talk when we get home says 
 
determined to see peeta privately after i toss and 
thought is to check the roof but its empty even the 
celebration last night i go back to bed for a while and 
to turn the knob i find my own bedroom door has 
initially but then theres a more insidious fear that 
been unable to escape since the hunger games 
this feels like ive been imprisoned for a crime and 
pretend to sleep until effie trinket comes to alert me 
i have about five minutes to eat a bowl of hot grain 
say is the crowd loved you and its unnecessary to 
comes in he shoos them out and dresses me in a 
personally adjusts my makeup until i seem to radiate 
afraid to ask him anything of real importance because 
feeling that im being watched constantly 
sitting room a space has been cleared and the love 
red and pink roses there are only a handful of 
caesar flickerman gives me a warm hug when i 
faring 
fine nervous about the interview i say 
says giving my cheek a reassuring pat 
nothing you say will be wrong he says 
actually president snow may be arranging some sort 
then peetas there looking handsome in red and 
you haymitch seems bent on keeping us apart 
there are too many ears listening so i just say yes 
well theres just this and we go home then he cant 
i feel a sort of shiver run through me and theres no 
sit somewhat formally on the love seat but caesar 
want it looked very sweet so i tuck my feet up and 
someone counts backward and just like that were 
flickerman is wonderful teasing joking getting 
peeta already have the rapport they established that 
smile a lot and try to speak as little as possible i 
mean i have to talk some but as soon as i can i 
eventually though caesar begins to pose questions 
from our days in the cave that it was love at first 
from the moment i laid eyes on her says peeta 
excitement for the audience was watching you fall for 
asks caesar 
and look down at my hands help 
shouted out his name from that tree says caesar 
yes i guess that was it i mean until that point i 
be honestly because it was so confusing and it only 
then in the tree everything changed i say 
maybe    because for the first time    there was a 
behind a cameraman i see haymitch give a sort of 
caesar pulls out a handkerchief and has to take a 
his forehead into my temple and he asks so now 
that youve got me what are you going to do with 
i turn in to him put you somewhere you cant get 
actually sigh 
the ways we did get hurt in the arena from burns to 
the mutts that i forget im on camera when caesar 
new leg i say and i cant help reaching out and 
whisper taking in the metalandplastic device that 
no one told you asks caesar gently i shake my 
i havent had the chance says peeta with a slight 
its my fault i say because i used that tourniquet 
hes right says caesar hed have bled to death for 
i guess this is true but i cant help feeling upset 
then i remember everyone in the country is watching 
them a couple of minutes to coax me back out 
me and when i do come out caesar backs off 
questioning me so i can recover in fact he pretty 
katniss i know youve had a shock but ive got to 
what was going on in your mind  hm he says 
my thoughts this is the crucial moment where i 
idea of losing peeta that i cant be held responsible for 
speech but all i get out is one almost inaudible 
thought of  being without him 
no i think that goes for both of us he says 
and crying and hugging but im still not sure until i 
perfect he answers 
theres nothing to take but the mockingjay pin madge 
games they drive us through the streets in a car 
us we barely have time to say goodbye to cinna and 
we tour the districts for a round of victory 
that the hunger games never really go away well be 
to pretend they love us 
the train begins moving and were plunged into night 
breath since the reaping effie is accompanying us 
enormous dinner and settle into silence in front of the 
capitol growing farther away every second i begin to 
excuse myself to change out of my dress and into a 
the makeup from my face and put my hair in its 
everdeen a girl who lives in the seam hunts in the 
to remember who i am and who i am not by the time 
my shoulders feels alien 
allowed to go outside for some fresh air theres no 
along the track hand in hand and i cant find 
gather a bunch of wildflowers for me when he 
he cant know that the pinkandwhite flowers are the 
ive spent gathering them with gale 
makes my stomach churn but why i cant quite 
been lying to someone who trusts me or more 
it up to this point because of the games but there 
whats wrong peeta asks 
nothing i answer we continue walking past the 
are no cameras hidden in the scrubby bushes along 
haymitch startles me when he lays a hand on my 
his voice down great job you two just keep it up in 
okay i watch him head back to the train avoiding 
whats he mean peeta asks me 
berries i blurt out 
it seemed too rebellious so haymitch has been 
make it worse i say 
he knew you were smart enough to get it right i 
i didnt know there was anything to get right says 
and then i guess    back in the arena    that was just 
no i mean i couldnt even talk to him in the arena 
but you knew what he wanted you to do didnt 
hand and i take a step as if to catch my balance 
it was all for the games peeta says how you 
not all of it i say tightly holding onto my flowers 
question is whats going to be left when we get home 
i dont know the closer we get to district twelve the 
explanation but nones forthcoming 
and the pain in his voice is palpable 
rumble of the engine i can hear every step he takes 
peeta has disappeared into his room for the night i 
next time he turns up were pulling into district 12 
i want to tell him that hes not being fair that we 
keep us both alive in the arena that i cant explain 
myself that its no good loving me because im never 
hating me later instead of sooner that if i do have 
able to afford the kind of love that leads to a family to 
weve just been through 
but that wouldnt be fair on my part 
so we just stand there silently watching our grimy 
i can see the platforms thick with cameras everyone 
out of the corner of my eye i see peeta extend his 
audience he says his voice isnt angry its hollow 
slipping away from me 
cameras and dreading the moment when i will finally
