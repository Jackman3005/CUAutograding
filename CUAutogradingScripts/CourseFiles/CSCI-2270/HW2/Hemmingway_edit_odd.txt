                                         by ernest hemingway

                                          to charlie shribner
                                            to max perkins

     he was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the gulf stream and he had gone eightyfour
without a fish the boys parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao
caught three good fish the first week it made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with
harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast the sail was patched with flour sacks and
     the old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck the brown
on his cheeks the blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deepcreased
erosions in a fishless desert
cheerful and undefeated
could go with you again weve made some money
     no the old man said youre with a lucky boat stay with them
every day for three weeks

     i know the old man said it is quite normal
      no the old man said but we have havent we
     why not the old man said between fishermen
angry others of the older fishermen looked at him and were sad but they did not show it and they
weather and of what they had seen the successful fishermen of that day were already in and had
staggering at the end of each plank to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry
the other side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle their livers removed their
     when the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark factory but
and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the terrace
     yes the old man said he was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago
     no go and play baseball i can still row and rogelio will throw the net
     you bought me a beer the old man said you are already a man
     five and you nearly were killed when i brought the fish in too green and he nearly tore the
     i can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the noise of the
the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like chopping a tree down and the sweet
      can you really remember that or did i just tell it to you
     the old man looked at him with his sunburned confident loving eyes
mothers and you are in a lucky boat
     i have mine left from today i put them in salt in the box
     one the old man said his hope and his confidence had never gone but now they were
     two the boy said
     i would the boy said but i bought these
but he  knew he had attained it and he knew it was not disgraceful and it carried no loss of true
     tomorrow is going to be a good day with this current he said
     far out to come in when the wind shifts i want to be out before it is light
come to your aid
     no the boy said but i will see something that he cannot see such as a bird working and get
     are his eyes that bad
     it is strange the old man said he never went turtleing that is what kills the eyes
     i am a strange old man
     i think so and there are many tricks
sardines
boy carried the wooden boat with the coiled hardbraided brown lines the gaff and the harpoon
used to subdue the big fish when they were brought alongside no one would steal from the old
though he was quite sure no local people would steal from him the old man thought that a gaff and
     they walked up the road together to the old mans shack and went in through its open door
other gear beside it the mast was nearly as long as the one room of the shack the shack was made
one chair and a place on the dirt floor to cook with charcoal on the brown walls of the flattened
of jesus and another of the virgin of cobre these were relics of his wife once there had been a
to see it and it was on the shelf in the corner under his clean shirt
     a pot of yellow rice with fish do you want some
     no i will make it later on or i may eat the rice cold
     of course
this fiction every day there was no pot of yellow rice and fish and the boy knew this too
that dressed out over a thousand pounds
      yes i have yesterdays paper and i will read the baseball
out from under the bed
keep yours and mine together on ice and we can share them in the morning when i come back you
     the yankees cannot lose
     have faith in the yankees my son think of the great dimaggio
     be careful or you will fear even the reds of cincinnati and the white sax of chicago
     do you think we should buy a terminal of the lottery with an eightyfive tomorrow is the
     we can do that the boy said but what about the eightyseven of your great record
     i can order one
     thats easy i can always borrow two dollars and a half
     keep warm old man the boy said remember we are in september
may
     when the boy came back the old man was asleep in the chair and the sun was down the boy
mans shoulders they were strange shoulders still powerful although very old and the neck was still
forward his shirt had been patched so many times that it was like the sail and the patches were
his eyes closed there was no life in his face the newspaper lay across his knees and the weight of his
     the boy left him there and when he came back the old man was still asleep
     the old man opened his eyes and for a moment he was coming back from a long way away
     what have you got he asked
     im not very hungry
     i have the old man said getting up and taking the newspaper and folding it then he started
     keep the blanket around you the boy said youll not fish without eating while im alive
     black beans and rice fried bananas and some stew
of knives and forks and spoons were in his pocket with a paper napkin wrapped around each set
     martin the owner
     i thanked him already the boy said you dont need to thank him
once
     i must give him something more than the belly meat then he is very thoughtful for us
     i like the beer in cans best
     thats very kind of you the old man said should we eat
until you were ready
     where did you wash the boy thought the village water supply was two streets down the road
thoughtless i must get him another shirt and a jacket for the winter and some sort of shoes and
     your stew is excellent the old man said
     in the american league it is the yankees as i said the old man said happily
     that means nothing the great dimaggio is himself again
     naturally but he makes the difference in the other league between brooklyn and
park
     do you remember when he used to come to the terrace
and you were too timid
of our lives
fisherman maybe he was as poor as we are and would understand
when he was my age
have seen lions on the beaches in the evening
     should we talk about africa or about baseball
     he used to come to the terrace sometimes too in the older days but he was rough and harsh
carried lists of  horses at all times in his pocket and frequently spoke the names of horses on the
     he was a great manager the boy said my father thinks he was the greatest
here each year your father would think him the greatest manager
     i think they are equal
     no i know others better
only you
wrong
     i may not be as strong as i think the old man said but i know many tricks and i have
     you ought to go to bed now so that you will be fresh in the morning i will take the things
      good night then i will wake you in the morning
     age is my alarm clock the old man said why do old men wake so early is it to have one
     i dont know the boy said all i know is that young boys sleep late and hard
     i do not like for him to waken me it is as though i were inferior
     sleep well old man
trousers and went to bed in the dark he rolled his trousers up to make a pillow putting the
covered the springs of the bed
beaches and the white beaches so white they hurt your eyes and the high capes and the great brown
saw the native boats  come riding through it he smelled the tar and oakum of the deck as he
     usually when he smelled the land breeze he woke up and dressed to go and wake the boy but
went on dreaming to see the white peaks of the islands rising from the sea and then he dreamed of
     he no longer dreamed of storms nor of women nor of great occurrences nor of great fish
on the beach they played like young cats in the dusk and he loved them as he loved the boy he
his trousers and put them on he urinated outside the shack and then went up the road to wake the
soon he would be rowing
with his  bare feet the boy was asleep on a cot in the first room and the old man could see him
until the boy woke and turned and looked at him the old man nodded and the boy took his
     the old man went out the door and the boy came after him he was sleepy and the old man put
     qua va the boy said it is what a man must do
men were moving carrying the masts of their boats
harpoon and gaff and the old man carried the mast with the furled sail on his shoulder
     well put the gear in the boat and then get some
     how did you sleep old man the boy asked he  was waking up now although it was still
     very well manolin the old man said i feel confident today
brings our gear himself he never wants anyone to carry anything
     i know it the boy said ill be right back have another coffee we have credit here
     the old man drank his coffee slowly it was all he would have all day and he knew that he
bottle of water in the bow of the skiff and that was all he needed for the day
went down the trail to the skiff feeling the pebbled sand under their feet and lifted the skiff and slid
      good luck old man
leaning forward against the thrust of the blades in the water he began to row out of the harbour in
dip and push of their oars even though he could not see them now the moon was below the hills
of the oars they spread apart after they were out of the mouth of the harbour and each one headed
he left the smell of the land behind and rowed out into the clean early morning smell of the ocean
that the fishermen called the great well because there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms
the floor of the ocean here there were concentrations of shrimp and bait fish and sometimes
wandering fish fed on them
sound as flying fish left the water and the hissing that their stiff set wings made as they soared away
was sorry for the birds especially the small delicate dark terns that were always flying and looking
robber birds and the heavy strong ones why did they make birds so delicate and fine as those sea
it comes so suddenly and such birds that fly dipping and hunting with their small sad voices are
     he always thought of the sea as la mar which is what people call her in spanish when they love
a woman some of the younger fishermen those who used buoys as floats for their lines and had
which is masculine they spoke of her as a contestant or a place or even an enemy but the old man
did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them the moon affects her as it does a
     he was rowing steadily and it was no effort for him since he kept well within his speed and the
current do a third of the work and as it started to be light he saw he was already further out than he
     i worked the deep wells for a week and did nothing he thought today ill work out where the
     before it was really light he had his baits out and was drifting with the current one bait was
water at one  hundred and one hundred and twentyfive fathoms each bait hung head down
hook the curve and the point was covered with fresh sardines each sardine was hooked through
that a great fish could feel which was not sweet smelling and good tasting
lines like plummets and on the others he had a big blue runner and a yellow jack that had been used
attractiveness each line as thick around as a big pencil was looped onto a greensapped stick so
which could be made fast to the other spare coils so that if it were necessary a fish could take out
     now the man watched the dip of the three sticks over the side of the skiff and rowed gently to
moment now the sun would rise
and well in toward the shore spread out across the current then the sun was brighter and the glare
and he rowed without looking into it he looked down into the water and watched the lines that
each level in the darkness of the stream there would be a bait waiting exactly where he wished it to
sixty fathoms when the fishermen thought they were at a hundred
maybe today every day is a new day it is better to be lucky but i would rather be exact then
     the sun was two hours higher now and it did not  hurt his eyes so much to look into the
     all my life the early sun has hurt my eyes he thought yet they are still good in the evening i
the morning it is painful
he made a quick drop slanting down on his backswept wings and then circled again
     he rowed slowly and steadily toward where the bird was circling he did not hurry and he kept
correctly though faster than he would have fished if he was not trying to use the bird
and the old man saw flying fish spurt out of the water and sail desperately over the surface
     he shipped his oars and brought a small line from under the bow it had a wire leader and a
made it fast to a ring bolt in the stern then he baited another line and left it coiled in the shade of
now low over the water
wildly and ineffectually as he followed the flying fish the old man could see the slight bulge in the
through the water below the flight of the fish and would be in the water driving at speed when the
little chance the bird has no chance the flying fish are too big for him and they go too fast
that school has gotten away from me he thought they are moving out too fast and too far but
somewhere
the gray blue hills behind it the water was a dark blue now so dark that it was almost purple as he
sun made now he watched his lines to see them go straight down out of sight into the water and he
water now that the sun was higher meant good weather and so did the shape of the clouds over the
some patches of yellow sunbleached sargasso weed and the purple formalized iridescent
and then righted itself it floated cheerfully as a bubble with its long deadly purple filaments trailing
      agua mala the man said you whore
fish that  were coloured like the trailing filaments and swam between them and under the small
same of the filaments would catch on a line and rest there slimy and purple while the old man was
poison oak can give but these poisonings from the agua mala came quickly and struck like a
      the iridescent bubbles were beautiful but they were the falsest thing in the sea and the old man
then shut their eyes so they were completely carapaced and ate them filaments and all the old man
them pop when he stepped on them with the horny soles of his feet
had a friendly contempt for the huge stupid loggerheads yellow in their armourplating strange in
      he had no mysticism about turtles although he had gone in turtle boats for many years he was
people are heartless about turtles because a turtles heart will beat for hours after he has been cut up
theirs he ate the white eggs to give himself strength he ate them all through may to be strong in
      he also drank a cup of shark liver oil each day from the big drum in the shack where many of
the taste but it was no worse than getting up at the hours that they rose and it was very good against
      now the old man looked up and saw that the bird was circling again
bait  fish but as the old man watched a small tuna rose in the air turned and dropped head first
another and another rose and they were jumping in all directions churning the water and leaping in
     if they dont travel too fast i will get into them the old man thought and he watched the
forced to the surface in their panic
where he had kept a loop of the line and he dropped his oars and felt tile weight of the small tunas
pulled in and he could see the blue back of the fish in the water and the gold of his sides before he
shaped his big unintelligent eyes staring as he thumped his life out against the planking of the boat
for kindness and kicked him his body still shuddering under the shade of the stern
     he did not remember when he had first started to talk aloud when he was by himself he had
steering on his watch in the smacks or in the turtle boats he had probably started to talk aloud
they usually spoke only when it was necessary they talked at night or when they were stormbound
always considered it so and respected it but now he said his thoughts aloud many times since there
     if the others heard me talking out loud they would think that i am crazy he said aloud but
bring them the baseball
thing that which i was born for there might be a big one around that school he thought i picked
everything that shows on the surface today travels very fast and to the northeast can that be the
     he could not see the green of the shore now but only the tops of the blue hills that showed
them the sea was very dark and the light made prisms in the water the myriad flecks of the
that the old man saw now with his lines going straight down into the water that was a mile deep
them by their proper names when they came to sell them or to trade them for baits were down
trickle down his back as he rowed
today is eightyfive days and i should fish the day well
     yes he said yes and shipped his oars without bumping the boat he reached out for the
weight and he held the line lightly then it came again this time it was a tentative pull not solid nor
sardines that covered the point and the shank of the hook where the handforged hook projected
     the old man held the line delicately and softly with his left hand unleashed it from the stick
     this far out he must be huge in this month he thought eat them fish eat them please eat
      how fresh they are and you down there six hundred feet in that cold water in the dark
     he felt the light delicate pulling and then a harder pull when a sardines head must have been
     come on the old man said aloud make another turn just smell them arent they lovely
them
same time for the fish might have swum up or down then came the same delicate pulling touch
     hell take it the old man said aloud god help him to take it
     he cant have gone he said christ knows he cant have gone hes making a turn maybe he
      then he felt the gentle touch on the line and he was happy
     he was happy feeling the gentle pulling and then he felt something hard and unbelievably
of the two reserve coils as it went down slipping lightly through the old mans fingers he still
     what a fish he said he has it sideways in his mouth now and he is moving off with it
said a good thing it might not happen he knew what a huge fish this was and he thought of him
stop moving but the weight was still there then the weight increased and he gave more line he
going straight down
     he let the line slip through his fingers while he reached down with his left hand and made fast
was ready he had three fortyfathom coils of line in reserve now as well as the coil he was using
     eat it so that the point of the hook goes into your heart and kills you he thought come up
table
again and again swinging with each arm alternately on the cord with all the strength of his arms and
     nothing happened the fish just moved away slowly and the old man could not raise him an
that beads of water were jumping from it then it began to make a slow hissing sound in the water
began to move slowly off toward the northwest
in the water but there was nothing to be done
bitt i could make the line fast but then he could break it i must hold him all i can and give him
      what i will do if he decides to go down i dont know what ill do if he sounds and dies i
      he held the line against his back and watched its slant in the water and the skiff moving steadily
      this will kill him the old man thought he cant do this forever but four hours later the fish
the line across his back
      he had pushed his straw hat hard down on his head before he hooked the fish and it was
on the line moved as far into the bow as he could get and reached the water bottle with one hand
mast and sail and tried not to think but only to endure
thought i can always come in on the glow from havana there are two more hours before the sun
he does not do that maybe he will come up with the sunrise i have no cramps and i feel strong it is
tight on the wire i wish i could see him i wish i could see him only once to know what i have
      the fish never changed his course nor his direction  all that night as far as the man could
on his back and his arms and his old legs during the day he had taken the sack that covered the bait
hung down over his back and he cautiously worked it down under the line that was across his
bow so that he was almost comfortable the position actually was only somewhat less intolerable
      i can do nothing with him and he can do nothing with me he thought not as long as he keeps
      once he stood up and urinated over the side of the skiff and looked at the stars and checked his
they were moving more slowly now and the glow of havana was not so strong so that he knew the
to the eastward he thought for if the fishs course held true i must see it for many more  hours
to do this with a radio then he thought think of it always think of what you are doing you must
      then he said aloud i wish i had the boy to help me and to see this
eat the tuna before he spoils in order to keep strong remember no matter how little you want to
     during the night two porpoises came around the boat and he could hear them rolling and
of the female
brothers like the flying fish
knows how old he is he thought never have i had such a strong fish nor one who acted so
perhaps he has been hooked many times before and he knows that this is how he should make his
fish he is and what will he bring in the market if the flesh is good he took the bait like a male and
desperate as i am
female fish feed first and the hooked fish the female made a wild panicstricken despairing fight
with her on the surface he had stayed so close that the old man was afraid he would cut the line
gaffed her and clubbed her holding the rapier bill with its sandpaper edge and dubbing her across
with the boys aid hoisted her aboard the male fish had stayed by the side of the boat then while
the air beside the boat to see where the female was and then went down deep his lavender wings
the old man remembered and he had stayed
and we begged her pardon and butchered her promptly
bow and felt the strength of the great fish through the line he held across his shoulders moving
     when once through my treachery it had been necessary to him to make a choice the old man
     his choice had been to stay in the deep dark water far out beyond all snares and traps and
world now we are joined together and have been since noon and no one to help either one of us
for i must surely remember to eat the tuna after it gets light
the stick break and the line begin to rush out over the gunwale of the skiff in the darkness he
cut the line against the wood of the gunwale then he cut the other line closest to him and in the
his foot on the coils to hold them as he drew his knots tight now he had six reserve coils of line
were all connected
link up the reserve coils i will have lost two hundred fathoms of good catalan cardel and the hooks
i dont know what that fish was that took the bait just now it could have been a marlin or a
     aloud he said i wish i had the boy
back to the last line now in the dark or not in the dark and cut it away and hook up the two reserve
     so he did it it was difficult in the dark and once the fish made a surge that pulled him down on
and dried before it reached his chin and he worked his way back to the bow and rested against the
shoulders and holding it anchored with his shoulders he carefully felt the pull of the fish and then
     i wonder what he made that lurch for he thought the wire must have slipped on the great hill
forever no matter how great he is now everything is cleared away that might make trouble and i
     fish he said softly aloud ill stay with you until i am dead
was cold now in the time before daylight and he pushed against the wood to be warm i can do it as
boat moved steadily and when the first edge of the sun rose it was on the old mans right shoulder
thought i wish he would turn with the current that would show that he was tiring
one favorable sign the slant of the line showed he was swimming at a lesser depth that did not
     god let him jump the old man said i have enough line to handle him
now that it is daylight let him jump so that hell fill the sacks along his backbone with air and then
      he tried to increase the tension but the line had been taut up to the very edge of the
knew he could put no more strain on it i must not jerk it ever he thought each jerk widens the cut
and for once i do not have to look into it
was pleased it was the yellow gulf weed that had made so much phosphorescence in the night
ends
     a small bird came toward the skiff from the north he was a warbler and flying very low over
     the bird made the stern of the boat and rested there then he flew around the old mans head
     how old are you the old man asked the bird is this your first trip
teetered on it as his delicate feet gripped it fast
night what are birds coming to
bird who could not understand him anyway and who would learn about the hawks soon enough
or fish
     stay at my house if you like bird he said i am sorry i cannot hoist the sail and take you in
     just then the fish gave a sudden lurch that pulled the old man down onto the bow and would
     the bird had flown up when the line jerked and the old man had not even seen him go he felt
     something hurt him then he said aloud and pulled back on the line to see if he could turn the
of the line
     he looked around for the bird now because he would have liked him for company the bird
     you did not stay long the man thought but it is rougher where you are going until you make
stupid or perhaps i was looking at the small bird and thinking of him now i will pay attention to
     i wish the boy were here and that i had some salt he said aloud
the ocean and held it there submerged for more than a  minute watching the blood trail away
     he has slowed much he said
another sudden lurch by the fish and he stood up and braced himself and held his hand up against
knew he would need his hands before this was over and he did not like to be cut before it started
gaff and eat him here in comfort
keeping it clear of the coiled lines holding the line with his left shoulder again and bracing on his
knee on the fish and cut strips of dark red meat longitudinally from the back of the head to the tail
of the belly when he had cut six strips he spread them out on the wood of the bow wiped his knife
     i dont think i can eat an entire one he said and drew his knife across one of the strips he
heavy cord and he looked at it in disgust
will do you no good
and it will strengthen the hand it is not the hands fault and you have been many hours with the
     he picked up a piece and put it in his mouth and chewed it slowly it was not unpleasant
with lemon or with salt
mortis ill eat some more for you
out the skin
     he took another full piece and chewed it
dolphin is too sweet this is hardly sweet at all and all the strength is still in it
and i do not know whether the sun will rot or dry what is left so i had better eat it all although i
     be patient hand he said i do this for you
to do it slowly and conscientiously he ate all of the wedgeshaped strips of fish
hand and i will handle him with the right arm alone until you  stop that nonsense he put his
     god help me to have the cramp go he said because i do not know what the fish is going to
     but he seems calm he thought and following his plan but what is his plan he thought and
but he stays down forever then i will stay down with him forever
not open maybe it will open with the sun he thought maybe it will open when the strong raw tuna
now by force let it open by itself and come back of its own accord after all i abused it much in
     he looked across the sea and knew how alone he was now but he could see the prisms in the
were building up now for the trade wind and he looked ahead and saw a  flight of wild ducks
man was ever alone on the sea
were right in the months of sudden bad weather but now they were in hurricane months and when
     if there is a hurricane you always see the signs of it in the sky for days ahead if you are at sea
make a difference too in the shape of the clouds but we have no hurricane coming now
above were the thin feathers of the cirrus against the high september sky
     his left hand was still cramped but he was unknotting it slowly
others to have a diarrhoea from ptomaine poisoning or to vomit from it but a cramp he thought of
      if the boy were here he could rub it for me and loosen it down from the forearm he thought
      then with his right hand he felt the difference in the pull of the line before he saw the slant
against his thigh he saw the line slanting slowly upward
      the line rose slowly and steadily and then the surface of the ocean bulged ahead of the boat and
sun and his head and back were dark purple and in the sun the stripes on his sides showed wide and
length from the water and then reentered it smoothly like a diver and the old  man saw the
      he is two feet longer than the skiff the old man said the line was going out fast but steadily
of breaking strength he knew that if he could not slow the fish with a steady pressure the fish could
      he is a great fish and i must convince him he thought i must never let him learn his strength
something broke but thank god they are not as intelligent as we who kill them although they are
      the old man had seen many great fish he had seen many that weighed more than a thousand
of land he was fast to the biggest fish that he had ever seen and bigger than he had ever heard of
       it will uncramp though he thought surely it will uncramp to help my right hand there are
cramped the fish had slowed again and was going at his usual pace
big he was i know now anyway he thought i wish i could show him what sort of man i am but
wish i was the fish he thought with everything he has against only my will and my intelligence
steadily and the boat moved slowly through the dark water there was a small sea rising with the
      bad news for you fish he said and shifted the line over the sacks that covered his shoulders
      i am not religious he said but i will say ten our  fathers and ten hail marys that i
that is a promise
not remember the prayer and then he would say them fast so that they would come automatically
      hail mary full of grace the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and blessed is
our death amen then he added blessed virgin pray for the death of this fish wonderful
      with his prayers said and feeling much better but suffering exactly as much and perhaps a
his left hand
      i had better rebait that little line out over the stern he said if the fish decides to stay
anything but a dolphin  here but if i eat him fresh enough he wont be bad i wish a flying fish
raw and i would not have to cut him up i must save all my strength now christ i did not know he
      ill kill him though he said in all his greatness and his glory
endures
      now is when i must prove it
time was a new time and he never thought about the past when he was doing it
main thing that is left dont think old man he said to himself rest gently now against the wood
      it was getting into the afternoon and the boat still moved slowly and steadily but there was an
hurt of the cord across his back came to him easily and smoothly
slightly higher level the sun was on the old mans left arm and shoulder and on his back so he
      now that he had seen him once he could picture the fish swimming in the water with his
much he sees at that depth the old man thought his eye is huge and a horse with much less eye
cat sees
and he began to shift more of the strain to it and he shrugged the muscles of his back to shift the
      if youre not tired fish he said aloud you must be very strange
things he thought of the big leagues to him they were the gran  ligas and he knew that the
      this is the second day now that i do not know the result of the juegos he thought but i must
with the pain of the bone spur in his heel what is a bone spur he asked himself un espuela de hueso
i could endure that or the loss of the eye and of both eyes and continue to fight as the fighting cocks
in the darkness of the sea
      do you believe the great dimaggio would stay with a fish as long as i will stay with this one he
but would the bone spur hurt him too much
      as the sun set he remembered to give himself more  confidence the time in the tavern at
strongest man on the docks they had gone one day and one night with their elbows on a chalk line
force the others hand down onto the table there was much betting and people went in and out of
negros face they changed the referees every four hours after the first eight so that the referees
looked each other in the eye and at their hands and forearms and the bettors went in and out of the
were of wood and the lamps threw their shadows against them the negros shadow was huge and it
      the odds would change back and forth all night and they fed the negro rum and lighted
      then the negro after the rum would try for a tremendous  effort and once he had the old
but the old man had raised his hand up to dead even again he was sure then that he had the negro
be called a draw and the referee was shaking his head he had unleashed his effort and forced the
morning and ended on a monday morning many of the bettors had asked for a draw because they
everyone would have wanted it to go to a finish but he had finished it anyway and before anyone
      for a long time after that everyone had called him the champion and there had been a return
broken the confidence of the negro from cienfuegos in the first match after that he had a few
he decided that it was bad for his right  hand for fishing he had tried a few practice matches
to do and he did not trust it
too cold in the night i wonder what this night will bring
schools of flying fish
if it was possible to gain any on his fish but he could not and it stayed at the hardness and water
until he could no longer see it
height they should be able to see the fish well if they do not fly too high i would like to fly very
crosstrees of the masthead and even at that height i saw much the dolphin look greener from
they swim why is it that all the fastmoving fish of the dark current have purple backs and usually
comes to feed truly hungry purple stripes show on his sides as on a marlin can it be anger or the
      just before it was dark as they passed a great island of sargasso weed that heaved and swung in
line was taken by a dolphin he saw it first when it jumped in the air true gold in the last of the sun
he worked his way back to the stern and crouching and holding the big line with his right hand and
left foot when the fish was at the stem plunging and cutting from side to side in desperation the
its jaws were working convulsively in quick bites against  the hook and it pounded the bottom of
until it shivered and was still
he worked his way slowly back to the bow he washed his left hand and wiped it on his trousers
while he watched the sun go into the ocean and the slant of the big cord
he noted that it was perceptibly slower
hes good for the night and so am i
can do that a little later and lash the oars to make a drag at the same time i had better keep the fish
fish he let his hand dry in the air then grasped the line  with it and eased himself as much as he
much or more than he did
eaten since he took the bait and he is huge and needs much food i have eaten the whole bonito
it it will be harder to eat than the bonito but then nothing is easy
food for a night and a day pull the boat fish
pain and gone into a dullness that he mistrusted but i have had worse things than that he thought
have gained on him in the question of sustenance
worn wood of the bow and rested all that he could the first stars  were out he did not know
distant friends
must kill him i am glad we do not have to try to kill the stars
imagine if a man each day should have to try to kill the sun we were born lucky he thought
never relaxed in his sorrow for him how many people will he feed he thought but are they worthy
behaviour and his great dignity
the sun or the moon or the stars it is enough to live on the sea and kill our true brothers
much line that i will lose him if he makes his effort and the drag  made by the oars is in place
since he has great speed that he has never yet employed no matter what passes i must gut the
      now i will rest an hour more and feel that he is solid and steady before i move back to the
any changes the oars are a good trick but it has reached the time to play for safety he is much fish
the punishment of the hook is nothing the punishment of hunger and that he is against
your next duty comes
had no way of judging the time nor was he really resting except comparatively he was still bearing
and confided more and more of the resistance to the fish to the skiff itself
could break it i must cushion the pull of the line with my body and at all times be ready to give line
      but you have not slept yet old man he said aloud it is half a day and a night and now
steady if you do not sleep you might become unclear in the head
brothers still i must sleep they sleep and the moon and the sun sleep and even the ocean sleeps
      but remember to sleep he thought make yourself do it and devise some simple and sure way
you must sleep
       he started to work his way back to the stern on his hands and knees being careful not to
must pull until he dies
and drew his knife from its sheath with his right hand the stars were bright now and he saw the
stern he put one of his feet on the fish and slit him quickly from the vent up to the tip of his lower
the gills clear
inside they were fresh and hard and he laid them side by side and dropped the guts and the gills
a leprous graywhite now in the starlight and the old man skinned one side of him while he held his
off from the head down to the tail
there was only the light of its slow descent he turned then and placed the two flying fish inside the
his back was bent with the weight of the line across it and he carried the fish in his right hand
after that he settled the line across his shoulders in a new place and held it again with his left hand
the speed of the water against his hand his hand was phosphorescent from skinning the fish and he
hand against the planking of the skiff particles of phosphorus floated off and drifted slowly astern
dolphin and get some rest and a little sleep
fillets and one of the flying fish gutted and with its head cut off
will never go in a boat again without salt or limes
salt he thought but then i did not hook the dolphin until almost sunset still it was a lack of
      the sky was clouding over to the east and one after another the stars he knew were gone it
      there will be bad weather in three or four days he said but not tonight and not tomorrow
      he held the line tight in his right hand and then pushed his thigh against his right hand as he
shoulders and braced his left hand on it
hand will wake me as the line goes out it is hard on the right hand but he is used to punishment
the line with all of his body putting all his weight onto his right band and he was asleep
or ten miles and it was in the time of their mating and they would leap high into the air and return
      then he dreamed that he was in the village on his bed and there was a norther and he was very
      after that he began to dream of the long yellow beach and he saw the first of the lions come
the bows where the ship lay anchored with the evening offshore breeze and he waited to see if
      the moon had been up for a long time but he slept  on and the fish pulled on steadily and
      he woke with the jerk of his right fist coming up against his face and the line burning out
and the line rushed out finally his left hand found the line and he leaned back against the line and
he looked back at the coils of line and they were feeding smoothly just then the fish jumped
boat was going fast although line was still racing out and the old man was raising the strain to
the bow and his face was in the cut slice of dolphin and he could not move
thought make him pay for it
splash as he fell the speed of the line was cutting his hands badly but he had always known this
the palm nor cut the fingers
boy were here
inch of it now he got his head up from the wood and out of the slice of fish that his cheek had
slowly all he time he worked back to where he could feel with his foot the coils of line that he
line through the water
his back with air and he cannot go down deep to die where i cannot bring him up he will start
been hunger that made him desperate  or was he frightened by something in the night maybe
confident it is strange
but you cannot get line but soon he has to circle
up water in his right hand to get the crushed dolphin flesh off of his face he was afraid that it might
right hand in the water over the side and then let it stay in the salt water while he watched the first
with the current soon he will have to circle then our true work begins
at it
      he took hold of the line carefully so that it did not fit into any of the fresh line cuts and shifted
      you did not do so badly for something worthless he said to his left hand but there was a
      why was i not born with two good hands he thought perhaps it was my fault in not training
the night though and he has only cramped once if he cramps again let the line cut him off
chew some more of the dolphin but i cant he told himself it is better to be lightheaded than to
keep it for an emergency until it goes bad but it is too late to try for strength now through
      it was there cleaned and ready and he picked it up with his left hand and ate it chewing the
      it has more nourishment than almost any fish he  thought at least the kind of strength that
      the sun was rising for the third time since he had put to sea when the fish started to circle
just felt a faint slackening of the pressure of the line and he commenced to pull on it gently with his
began to come in he slipped his shoulders and head from under the line and began to pull in line
much as he could with his body and his legs his old legs and shoulders pivoted with the swinging of
      it is a very big circle he said but he is circling then the line would not come in any more
knelt down and let it go grudgingly back into the dark water
strain will  shorten his circle each time perhaps in an hour i will see him now i must convince
      but the fish kept on circling slowly and the old man was wet with sweat and tired deep into his
could tell the fish had risen steadily while he swam
eyes and salted the cut over his eye and on his forehead he was not afraid of the black spots they
and that had worried him
beautifully god help me endure ill say a hundred our fathers and a hundred hail marys but i
      consider them said he thought ill say them later just then he felt a sudden banging and
      he is hitting the wire leader with his spear he  thought that was bound to come he had
were necessary for him to take air but after that each one can widen the opening of the hook
      dont jump fish he said dont jump
little line
pain could drive him mad
was gaining line steadily now but he felt faint again he lifted some sea water with his left hand and
      i have no cramps he said hell be up soon and i can last you have to last dont even
      he kneeled against the bow and for a moment slipped the line over his back again ill rest
decided
without recovering any line but when the strain showed the fish had turned to come toward the
the line he gained
good to take him in with i need that badly
turns more i will have him
the line as he felt the fish turn
     the sea had risen considerably but it was a fairweather breeze and he had to have it to get
     ill just steer south and west he said a man is never lost at sea and it is a long island
     he saw him first as a dark shadow that took so long  to pass under the boat that he could
     no he said he cant be that big
and the man saw his tail out of water it was higher than a big scythe blade and a very pale lavender
could see his huge bulk and the purple stripes that banded him his dorsal fin was down and his
     on this circle the old man could see the fishs eye and the two gray sucking fish that swain
they would swim easily in his shadow they were each over three feet long and when they swam fast
     the old man was sweating now but from something else besides the sun on each calm placid
chance to get the harpoon in
heart
     on the next circle the fishs beck was out but he was a little too far from the boat on the next
gaining some more line he could have him alongside
end was made fast to the bitt in the bow
moving the old man pulled on him all that he could to bring him closer for just a moment the fish
     i moved him the old man said i moved him then
he thought maybe this time i can get him over pull hands he thought hold up legs last for me
      but when he put all of his effort on starting it well out before the fish came alongside and
      fish the old man said fish you are going to have to die anyway do you have to kill me
      that way nothing is accomplished he thought his mouth was too dry to speak but he could
more turns yes you are he told himself youre good for ever
      you are killing me fish the old man thought but you have a right to never have i seen a
i do not care who kills who
your head clear and know how to suffer like a man or a fish he thought
       twice more it was the same on the turns
i do not know but i will try it once more
himself and swam off again slowly with the great tail weaving in the air
see well in flashes
i will try it once again
against the fishs agony and the fish came over onto his side and swam gently on his side his bill
barred with purple and interminable in the water
and drove it down with all his strength and more strength he had  just summoned into the
he felt the iron go in and he leaned on it and drove it further and then pushed all his weight after it
great length and width and all his power and his beauty he seemed to hang in the air above the old
all of the skiff
let it run slowly through his raw hands and when he could see he saw the fish was on his back with
the sea was discolouring with the red of the blood from his heart first it was dark as a shoal in the
and floated with the waves
the harpoon  line around the bitt in the bow and hid his head on his hands
killed this fish which is my brother and now i must do the slave work
were two and swamped her to load him and bailed her out this skiff would never hold him i must
      he started to pull the fish in to have him alongside so that he could pass a line through his gills
touch and to feel him he is my fortune he thought but that is not why i wish to feel him i think i
and make him fast and get the noose around his tail and another around his middle to bind him to
     get to work old man he said he took a very  small drink of the water there is very
     he looked up at the sky and then out to his fish he looked at the sun carefully it is not much
and i will splice them when we are home
     instead he lay there wallowing now in the seas and the old man pulled the skiff upon to him
size but he untied the harpoon rope from the bitt passed it through the fishs gills and out his jaws
around the bill and knotted the double rope and made it fast to the bitt in the bow he cut the rope
and the stripes showed the same pale violet colour as his tail they were wider than a mans hand
saint in a procession
and he knew he would not go away and his head was clear hes over fifteen hundred pounds the
pound
would be proud of me today i had no bone spurs but the hands and the back hurt truly i wonder
     he made the fish fast to bow and stern and to the middle thwart he was so big it was like
bill so his mouth would not open and they would sail as cleanly as possible then he stepped the
began to move and half lying in the stern he sailed southwest

were rotten so he hooked a patch of yellow gulf weed with the gaff as they passed and shook it so
dozen of them and they jumped and kicked like sand fleas the old man pinched their heads off
but he knew they were nourishing and they tasted good
eaten the shrimps the skiff was sailing well considering the handicaps and he steered with the tiller
the stern to know that this had truly happened and was not a dream at one time when he was
fish come out of the water and hang motionless in the sky before he fell he was sure there was some
      then he could not see well although now he saw as well as ever now he knew there was
clean and the salt water will heal them the dark water of the true gulf is the greatest healer that
his mouth shut and his tail straight up and down we sail like brothers then his head started to
towing him behind there would be no question nor if the fish were in the skiff with all dignity
old man thought let him bring me in if it pleases him i am only better than him through trickery
     they sailed well and the old man soaked his hands in the salt water and tried to keep his head
breeze would last all night the old man looked at the fish constantly  to make sure it was true it
     the shark was not an accident he had come up from deep down in the water as the dark cloud
without caution that he broke the surface of the blue water and was in the sun then he fell back
taken
swam fast and hard on the course he was a very big make shark built to swim as fast as the fastest
sword fishs and his belly was silver and his hide was smooth and handsome he was built as a
surface with his high dorsal fin knifing through the water without wavering inside the closed double
pyramidshaped teeth of most sharks they were shaped like a mans  fingers when they are
cutting edges on both sides this was a fish built to feed on all the fishes in the sea that were so fast
fresher scent and his blue dorsal fin cut the water
would do exactly what he wished he prepared the harpoon and made the rope fast while he
     the old mans head was clear and good now and he was full of resolution but he had little
close in it might as well have been a dream he thought i cannot keep him from hitting me but
     the shark closed fast astern and when he hit the fish the old man saw his mouth open and his
the sharks head  was out of water and his back was coming out and the old man could hear
sharks head at a spot where the line between his eyes intersected with the line that ran straight back
and the clicking thrusting allswallowing jaws but that was the location of the brain and the old
hit it without hope but with resolution and complete malignancy
again wrapping himself in two loops of the rope the old man knew that he was dead but the shark
over the water as a speedboat does the water was white where his tail beat it and threequarters of
lay quietly for a little while on the surface and the old man watched him then he went down very
       he took about forty pounds the old man said aloud he took my harpoon too and all
      he did not like to look at the fish anymore since he had been mutilated when the fish had
      but i killed the shark that hit my fish he thought and he was the biggest dentuso that i have
      it was too good to last he thought i wish it had been a dream now and that i had never
      but man is not made for defeat he said a man can be destroyed but not defeated i am
the harpoon the dentuso is cruel and able and strong and intelligent but i was more intelligent
      dont think old man he said aloud sail on this course and take it when it comes
great  dimaggio would have liked the way i hit him in the brain it was no great thing he
spurs i cannot know i never had anything wrong with my heel except the time the sting ray stung it
      think about something cheerful old man he said every minute now you are closer to
      he knew quite well the pattern of what could happen when he reached the inner part of the
      yes there is he said aloud i can lash my knife to the butt of one of the oars
      now he said i am still an old man but i am not unarmed
and some of his hope returned
thought there are enough problems now without sin also i have no understanding of it
the fish i suppose it was even though i did it to keep me alive and feed many people but then
paid to do it let them think about it you were born to be a fisherman as the fish was born to be a
      but he liked to think about all things that he was involved in and since there was nothing to
kill the fish only to keep alive and to sell for food he thought you killed him for pride and because
not a sin to kill him or is it more
      but you enjoyed killing the dentuso he thought he lives on the live fish as you do he is not a
no fear of anything
     besides he thought everything kills everything else in some way fishing kills me exactly as it
     he leaned over the side and pulled loose a piece of the meat of the fish where the shark had cut
not red there was no stringiness in it and he knew that it would bring the highest price in the
had time was coming
that it would not fall off the old man looked ahead of him but he could see no sails nor could he
sailing away to either side and the yellow patches of gulf weed he could not even see a bird
from the marlin trying to rest and to be strong when he saw the first of the two sharks
man might make involuntarily feeling the nail go through his hands and into the wood
identified them as shovelnosed sharks by the brown triangular fin and the sweeping movements of
losing and finding the scent in their excitement but they were closing all the time
lashed to it he lifted it as lightly as he could because his hands rebelled at the pain then he opened
and would not flinch and watched the sharks come he could see their wide flattened shovel
smelling scavengers as well as killers and when they were hungry they would bite at an oar or the
were asleep on the surface and they would hit a man in the water if they were hungry even if the
     ay the old man said galanos come on galanos
under the skiff and the old man could feel the skiff shake as he jerked and pulled on the fish the
jaws wide to hit the fish where he had already been bitten the line showed clearly on the top of his
oar into the juncture withdrew it and drove it in again into the sharks yellow catlike eyes the
     the skiff was still shaking with the destruction the other shark was doing to the fish and the old
under when he saw the shark he leaned over the side and punched at him he hit only meat and the
too but the shark came up fast with his head out and the old man hit him squarely in the center of
the blade and punched the shark exactly in the same spot again he still hung to the fish with his
     no the old man said and he drove the blade between the vertebrae and the brain it was an
between the sharks jaws to open them he twisted the blade and as the shark slid loose he said go
     the old man wiped the blade of his knife and laid down the oar then he found the sheet and
      they must have taken a quarter of him and of the best meat he said aloud i wish it
he stopped and he did not want to look at the fish now drained of blood and awash he looked the
     i shouldnt have gone out so far fish he said neither for you nor for me im sorry fish
your hand in order because there still is more to come
oar butt i should have brought a stone you should have brought many things he thought but
you can do with what there is
     he held the tiller under his arm and soaked both his hands in the water as the skiff drove
     god knows how much that last one took he said
fish he knew that each of the jerking bumps of the shark had been meat torn away and that the fish
     he was a fish to keep a man all winter he thought dont think of that just rest and try to get
now with all that scent in the water besides they do not bleed much there is nothing cut that
     what can i think of now he thought nothing i must think of nothing and wait for the next
     the next shark that came was a single shovelnose he came like a pig to the trough if a pig had
the knife on the oar don into his brain but the shark jerked backwards as he rolled and the knife
     the old man settled himself to steer he did not even watch the big shark sinking slowly in the
did not even watch it now
the short club
long as i have the oars and the short club and the tiller
saw nothing but the sea and the sky there was more wind in the sky than there had been and soon
     youre tired old man he said youre tired inside
     the old man saw the brown fins coming along the wide trail the fish must make in the water
by side

the top of the head he thought
into the silver side of the fish he raised the club high and brought it down heavy and slamming onto
rigidity of bone too and he struck the shark once more hard across the point of the nose as he slid
     the other shark had been in and out and now came in again with his jaws wide the old man
fish and closed his jaws he swung at him and hit only the head and the shark looked at him and
to swallow and hit only the heavy solid rubberiness
     the shark came in a rush and the old man hit him as he shut his jaws he hit him solidly and
hit him again in the same place while the shark tore the meat loose sluggishly and slid down from
     the old man watched for him to come again but neither shark showed then he saw one on the
     i could not expect to kill them he thought i could have in my time but i have hurt them both
killed the first one surely even now he thought
gone down while he had been in the fight with the sharks
the eastward i will see the lights of one of the new beaches
boy to worry of course but i am sure he would have confidence many of the older fishermen will
     he could not talk to the fish anymore because the fish had been ruined too badly then
     half fish he said fish that you were i am sorry that i went too far out i ruined us both
fish you do not have that spear on your head for nothing
have chopped the bill off to fight them with he thought but there was no hatchet and then there
     but if i had and could have lashed it to an oar butt what a weapon then we might have
     fight them he said ill fight them until i die

he leaned his back against the stern and knew he was not dead his shoulders told him
them now i better get the sack and put it over my shoulders
he thought maybe ill have the luck to bring the forward half in i should have some luck no he
     dont be silly he said aloud and keep awake and steer you may have much luck yet
     what could i buy it with he asked himself could i buy it with a lost harpoon and a broken
     you might he said you tried to buy it with  eightyfour days at sea they nearly sold it
     i must not think nonsense he thought luck is a thing that comes in many forms and who can

pack and he could only see the lines in the water that their fins made and their phosphorescence as
the skiff as they took hold below he clubbed desperately at what he could only feel and hear and he
     he jerked the tiller free from the rudder and beat and chopped with it holding it in both hands
other and together tearing off the pieces of meat that showed glowing below the sea as they turned
     one came finally against the head itself and he knew that it was over he swung the tiller
not tear he swung it once and twice and again he heard the tiller break and he lunged at the shark
go and rolled away that was the  last shark of the pack that came there was nothing more for
     the old man could hardly breathe now and he felt a strange taste in his mouth it was coppery
     he spat into the ocean and said eat that galanos and make a dream youve killed a man
found the jagged end of the tiller would fit in the slot of the rudder well enough for him to steer he
had no thoughts nor any feelings of any kind he was past everything now and he sailed the skiff to
someone might pick up crumbs from the table the old man paid no attention to them and did not
sailed now there was no great weight beside her
is easily replaced
along the shore he knew where he was now and it was nothing to get home
our friends and our enemies and bed he thought bed is my friend just bed he thought bed will
beat you he thought
     when he sailed into the little harbour the lights of the terrace were out and he knew everyone
though and he sailed up onto the little patch of shingle below the rocks there was no one to help
      he unstepped the mast and furled the sail and tied it then he shouldered the mast and
looked back and saw in the reflection from the street light the great tail of the fish standing up well
with the projecting bill and all the nakedness between
shoulder he tried to get up but it was too difficult and he sat there with the mast on his shoulder
watched it then he just watched the road
and started up the road he had to sit down five times before he reached his shack
took a drink then he lay down on the bed he pulled the blanket  over his shoulders and then
palms of his hands up
driftingboats would not be going out and the boy had slept late and then come to the old mans
the old mans hands and he started to cry he went out very quietly to go to bring some coffee and
     many fishermen were around the skiff looking at what was lashed beside it and one was in the
     the boy did not go down he had been there before and one of the fishermen was looking
     how is he one of the fishermen shouted
     he was eighteen feet from nose to tail the fisherman who was measuring him called
     he went into the terrace and asked for a can of coffee
     anything more
     what a fish it was the proprietor said there has never been such a fish those were two
     damn my fish the boy said and he started to cry again
     no the boy said tell them not to bother santiago ill be back
     thanks the boy said
once it looked as though he were waking but he had gone back into heavy sleep and the boy had
     finally the old man woke
     he poured some of the coffee in a glass
     they beat me manolin he said they truly beat me
     no truly it was afterwards
     let pedrico chop it up to use in fish traps
     you keep it if you want it
     did they search for me
     the ocean is very big and a skiff is small and hard to see the old man said he noticed how
missed you he said what did you catch
      very good
     no i am not lucky i am not lucky anymore

     as the boy went out the door and down the worn coral rock road he was crying again
among the empty beer cans and dead barracudas a woman saw a great long white spine with a huge
the entrance to the harbour
now just garbage waiting to go out with the tide
     i didnt know sharks had such handsome beautifully formed tails
     up the road in his shack the old man was sleeping again he was still sleeping on his face and
